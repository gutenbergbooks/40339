<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<blockquote>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I fancy, <i>Trimmer</i>, that if You and I could but</span><br>
get leave to peep out of our Graves again a matter<br>
of a hundred and fifty year hence, we should find<br>
these Papers in Bodlies Library, among the Memorialls<br>
of State; and Celebrated for the Only Warrantable<br>
Remains concerning this Juncture of Affairs.</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(<i>Observator</i> No. 259, 16 December 1682)</p>


<p>When the first of 931 single, folio sheets of the <i>Observator</i> appeared
on 13 April 1681, the sixty-five-year-old Roger L'Estrange, their sole
author, had been a controversial London Royalist for over twenty years.
As Crown protégé, he had served intermittently as Surveyor of the Press,
Chief Licenser, and Justice of the King's Peace Commission; as a writer,
he had produced two newspapers, the <i>Intelligencer</i> and the <i>Newes</i>
(1663-1666), dozens of political pamphlets, and seven translations from
Spanish, Latin, and French.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Rightly nicknamed "bloodhound of the
press," L'Estrange was notorious for his ruthless ferreting out of
illegal presses and seditious publishers, as well as for his tireless
warfare against the powerful Stationers' Company.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> No less well known
were his intransigent reactionary views, for we can estimate that some
64,000 copies of pamphlets bearing his name were circulating in the City
during the two years preceding the <i>Observator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Thus the
<i>Observator</i> papers represent not only the official propaganda of the
restored monarchy, but also the intellectual temper of a powerful,
influential man whose London fame was sufficiently demonstrated in the
winter of 1680, when he was publicly burned in effigy during that year's
Pope-burning festivities.</p>

<p>In the muddy torrent of "Intelligences," "Mercuries," "Courants,"
"Pacquets," and sundry newssheets, the <i>Observator</i> marks the beginnings
of a new sort of journalism, one which was to shape the development of
the English periodical. Although <i>Heraclitus Ridens</i> and its opponent
<i>Democritus Ridens</i> initiated the dialogue form for the newspaper
seventy-two days before the <i>Observator</i>, their relatively short run
relegates these pioneers to a shadowy background, as it does the even
earlier trade paper in dialogue, the <i>City and Country Mercury</i>
(1667).<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The eighty-two issues of <i>Heraclitus Ridens</i> and thirteen of<span class="pagenum">[Pg ii]</span>
<i>Democritus Ridens</i> cannot be compared in quantity to the 931 issues of
the <i>Observator</i> published three or four times a week from 13 April 1681
to 9 March 1687, nor can their stiff dialogues be compared in importance
to L'Estrange's much fuller exploitation of the form. Consequently, even
though he did not initiate the newspaper in dialogue form, L'Estrange is
unanimously given the honor of having popularized the form, or, in the
words of Richmond P. Bond, of having "borrowed the dialogue and fastened
it on English journalism for a generation as a factional procedure."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Imitators did not wait long. Nine days after the first <i>Observator</i>,
L'Estrange's arch-enemy, Harry Care, changed to dialogue the <i>Popish
Courant</i> section of his <i>Weekly Pacquet of Advice from Rome</i>,
relinquishing the expository format which he had followed since 1678.
Later, after the Glorious Revolution, the popularity of L'Estrange's
paper is evident in the spate of imitative "Observators" that ensued:
<i>The English Spy: Or, the Critical Observator</i> (1693); <i>The Poetical
Observator</i> (1702); Tutchin's <i>Observator</i> (1702&mdash;a Whig organ) and
Leslie's <i>Observator</i> (1704&mdash;a Tory organ); <i>The Comicall Observator</i>
(1704); <i>The Observator Reviv'd</i> (1707), and more. As late as 1716 there
was created a <i>Weekly Observator</i>. By the turn of the century, the very
term "Observator" had come to signify a controversy <i>in dialogue</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Interestingly enough, even the typography of L'Estrange's <i>Observator</i>
may have left its mark on succeeding journals. A brief comparison of
Interregnum newspapers (such as <i>Newes Out of Ireland</i> in 1642, <i>The
Scotch Mercury</i> in 1643, <i>The Commonwealth Mercury</i> in 1658) with John
Dunton's <i>The Athenian Mercury</i> (1693) and Charles Leslie's <i>Observator</i>
(1704) reveals a marked difference in typography. In the earlier papers
the typography is generally uniform, with italics used for proper names
and quotations, whereas L'Estrange's and Leslie's papers exhibit the
whole range of typeface available to the seventeenth-century printer.
Dissenter Dunton's <i>Athenian Mercury</i>, on the other hand, shows much
less eccentricity in its typography, limiting itself to generous use of
italics only, while Defoe's <i>Review</i> goes back to the earlier restraint
and presents a neat, uniform page. Whether these typographical
differences are attributable to particular political views or merely to
"schools" of printing is difficult to say.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg iii]</span></p>

<p>In addition to this obvious sort of superficial imitation, there are
many indications that L'Estrange's <i>Observator</i> had a more permanent
influence on posterity. It has been suggested that the periodical
specializing in query and answer between reader and editor, which was
initiated by John Dunton's <i>Athenian Mercury</i> and which we still have
today, may have been inspired by the <i>Observator</i>'s habitual retorts to
opponents.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> James Sutherland isolates in Defoe certain qualities of
prose style which he attributes to Defoe's extensive reading of
L'Estrange; and he sees L'Estrange's natural colloquial manner as
setting a pattern for journalists who followed him.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Far-fetched as it
may seem at first glance, even Addison's <i>Spectator</i> shows a certain
similarity to the <i>Observator</i>. Although the manner, tone, language, and
political views of the two are antithetical, the <i>Spectator</i>'s peculiar
blend of moralizing and diversion is reminiscent of L'Estrange's work.
In both papers we notice a serious didactic purpose tempered by literary
techniques and imaginative handling of material. Decades before
Addison's famous credo&mdash;"to make their Instruction Agreeable, and their
Diversion useful ... to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit
with Morality"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;L'Estrange had formulated a similar theory:</p>

<blockquote><i>Obs.</i>: Where there has been Any thing of That which you
call Raillery, or Farce; It has amounted to no more then
a Speaking to the Common People in their Own Way....
He that Talks Dry Reason to them, does as good as treat
'em in an Unknown Tongue; and there's no Other way of
Conveying the True Sense, &amp; Notion of Things, either to
their Affections, or to their Understandings, then by the
Palate....</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(II, No. 15)</p>

<p>And as a link between L'Estrange and Addison we have Defoe's analogous
promise in "the Introduction" to the <i>Review</i>: "After our Serious
Matters are over, we shall at the end of every Paper, Present you with a
little Diversion, as any thing occurs to make the World Merry."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
These notions rest, of course, on the ancient <i>dulce et utile</i>, though
modified in various ways in each of the three papers to suit the
temperaments of their writers, the tastes of their mass-audiences, and
different times. It is perhaps not irresponsible, then, to say that the<span class="pagenum">[Pg iv]</span>
synonymous titles of Addison's and L'Estrange's periodicals symbolize an
affinity of purpose and technique. Indeed, the <i>Observator</i> can, in many
ways, be considered a rather crude and primitive ancestor of the
<i>Spectator</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The purpose of the <i>Observator</i> and its main targets are clearly
formulated in <i>Observator</i> No. 1, as well as in the prefatory "To the
Reader," which was written in 1683 for the publication of Volume 1 of
the collected papers. The "faction" which L'Estrange proposes to reprove
consists at first (1681-1682) of Shaftesbury's republican-minded
followers and of the perpetrators of the Popish Plot. In his evaluation
of the Plot, L'Estrange agrees with some modern historians,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for he
never doubted that it was a Whig fabrication, an invented cause around
which the party members could rally and which neatly veiled the
parliamentary power-struggle behind the scenes. Titus Oates is
consequently the <i>Observator</i>'s <i>bête noire</i>, and Andrew Marvell's
pamphlet, <i>The Growth of Popery</i>, is for L'Estrange the odious origin of
the Plot:</p>

<blockquote><i>Obs.</i>: I do not know Any man throughout the whole Tract
of the Controversy that has held a Candle to the Devil
with a Better Grace then the Author of that Pamphlet ...
that Furnishes so Clear a Light toward the Opening of
the Roots, Springs, and Causes of our Late Miserable
Disorders, and Confusions.... Prethee let Otes'es
Popish Plot, Stand, or Fall, to it's Own Master; provided
that Marvels may be Allow'd to be the Elder Brother....</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(II, No. 16)</p>

<p>Toward the end of 1682, when the Whigs had ceased being an imminent
threat to the government and all but one of the Whig newspapers had been
silenced, L'Estrange turned his attack against the more moderate
Trimmers, as illustrated in <i>Observator</i> III, No. 88. But whether the
offensive is against Whigs or Trimmers, Dissenters and advocates of
toleration are always in the line of L'Estrange's fire as chief
subverters of absolute monarchy and of the Church of England, as is
evident in the satire of <i>Observator</i> Nos. 13 and 110. On the eve of the
Glorious Revolution, this rigid stand lost him the support of both the
Anglican clergy and the universities, support of which he was so proud
in his "To the Reader." Finally, <i>Observator</i> No. 1 singles out the<span class="pagenum">[Pg v]</span>
Whig press as one of its chief targets. The "Smith" referred to in that
first number is Anabaptist Francis "Elephant" Smith, publisher of the
outrageous <i>Mirabilis Annus</i> books, the inflammatory pamphlet <i>Vox
Populi</i>, and the offensive paper <i>Smith's Protestant Intelligence</i>;
"Harris" is Benjamin Harris, publisher of the Whig paper, <i>Domestic
Intelligence</i>. These, together with Harry Care (<i>Weekly Pacquet of
Advice from Rome</i> and <i>Popish Courant</i>), Richard Janeway (<i>Impartial
Protestant Mercury</i>), Langley Curtis (<i>The Protestant Mercury</i>), and
hordes of anti-Royalist authors or publications are habitually quoted or
referred to in L'Estrange's counterpropaganda. His untiring countering
of Whig publications earned him Nahum Tate's hyperbolic praise in <i>The
Second Part of Absalom and Achitophel</i>:</p>

<blockquote>Than <i>Sheva</i>, none more loyal Zeal have shown,
Wakefull, as <i>Judah</i>'s Lion for the Crown,
Who for that Cause still combats in his Age,
For which his Youth with danger did engage.
In vain our factious Priests the Cant revive,
In vain seditious Scribes with Libels strive
T'enflame the Crow'd, while He with watchfull Eye
Observes, and shoots their Treasons as they fly.
Their weekly Frauds his keen Replies detect,
He undeceives more fast than they infect.
So <i>Moses</i> when the Pest on <i>Legions</i> prey'd,
Advanc'd his Signal and the Plague was stay'd.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Parochial as these concerns seem today, the <i>Observator</i> in its totality
goes far beyond the Harry Cares and "Elephant" Smiths in its exhortation
to greater rationality in areas ancillary to but transcending politics
proper. Its assiduous ridicule of Enthusiasm, following in the steps of
Meric Casaubon and Henry More,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> its analyses of political
manipulation of the naive populace, its explanations of psychological
appeals, its Orwellian warnings against the snares of loaded diction and
the dangers of affective political rhetoric&mdash;all these efforts evident
in the few <i>Observators</i> represented here are an important step in the
direction of a less superstitious, less hysterical century.
Paradoxically, L'Estrange mobilized progressive ideas in the service of
an archaic political and religious administration, thereby familiarizing
the man on the street with notions and attitudes commonly known as<span class="pagenum">[Pg vi]</span>
Enlightened.</p>

<p>The sugar coating in the <i>Observator</i> is, however, as significant as the
pill, and distinguishes L'Estrange's journalism from his predecessors'.
Apart from the traditional satiric blend of verbal banter and polemic,
which has received ample commentary,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> his use of established literary
modes further enhances the colloquies, making them especially diverting
for his audience and interesting for us. As dialogues, the papers belong
to a genre whose popularity has remained constant from Plato onward. The
appeal of the form lies in its pleasurable verisimilitude, immediacy,
adaptability to differing points of view, and, especially after the
Restoration, in its potentiality for humorous repartee.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> As <i>satiric</i>
dialogues, L'Estrange's sheets satisfy what seems to be a universal love
of ridicule, an innate trait of the human mind, although there is no
agreement among students of satire as to its exact psychological
operations. In addition to adopting this form, which belongs to
imaginative literature rather than to journalism, L'Estrange spices his
<i>Observator</i> with a number of other devices designed to provide variety,
change in speed, and amusement for his reader, who is in turn bullied,
joshed, castigated, reasoned, or laughed into accepting L'Estrange's
views.</p>

<p>Frequently, for example, the dialogue gives way to a pointed anecdote
(old or current, invented or factual), such as the story of Jack of
Leyden in <i>Observator</i> No. 1, or the following from a later dialogue,
humorously satirizing the dour William Prynne and the Puritans' strange
concepts of sin:</p>

<blockquote><i>Trimmer</i>: A Gentleman that had Cut-off his own hair on
the Saturday, came the next day to Church in his first Perriwig.
The Parson (that was already Enter'd into his Sermon)
turn'd his Discourse presently, from his Text in the
Holy Bible, to the Subject of Prynnes <i>Unloveliness of</i>
<i>Lovelocks</i>; and Thrash'd for a matter of a Quarter of an
hour, upon the Mortal Sin of Wearing False Hair. The
Gentleman, finding that he would never give him over,
'till he had Preach'd him into a Flat State of Reprobation,
fairly took off his Perriwig, and Clapt it upon One of the
Buttons at the Corner of the Pew. The Poor Man had not
One word more to say to the Perriwig; and was run so far<span class="pagenum">[Pg vii]</span>
from his Text, that he could not for his heart find the way
home again: So that to make short on't; He gave the
People his Blessing, and Dismiss'd the Congregation.</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(II, No. 21)</p>

<p>Frequently, also, L'Estrange satirizes by means of parody or ludicrous
examples of his enemies' rhetoric or behavior, as in the case of the
"Dissenting Academies" in <i>Observator</i> No. 110. But most important of
the techniques for entertaining are his creation of carefully delineated
speaker-<i>personae</i> and his "Characters," again both borrowed from the
literary tradition.</p>

<p>After the first twenty-nine <i>Observators</i>, which are experimental in
that "Q" and "A" have shifting personalities (as in Nos. 1 and 13),
L'Estrange manipulates "Whig" and "Tory" for 171 papers, changes to
"Whig" and "Observator" for 33 papers, briefly (six papers) shifts to
"Whig" and "Courantier," and finally settles down to "Trimmer" and
"Observator" for the remaining 692 papers. In all these, the Tory
satirist (whether he be "Tory" or "Observator") is presented as the
conventional "snarling dog" described by Robert C. Elliott,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> with
appropriate outbursts of polemic, invective, bitter irony, and railing
humor. Even the traditional crudity is there, although compared to, say,
the <i>Popish Courant</i>, L'Estrange manifests a Victorian restraint.
"Whig," on the other hand, is presented as a naive, credulous,
not-too-bright individual whose main fault is not so much that he is a
Whig but that he is a Whig because he has no mental capacity for
discrimination. The "A" speaker of No. 13 (apparently a humorous thrust
at John Eachard, author of <i>Grounds and Occasions of the Contempt of the
Clergy</i>) with his preference for Prynne, Baxter, and Smith over Tacitus,
Livy, and Caesar, is typical of the later "Whig" <i>persona</i>. Humorless,
misguided, and chronically given to believing even the most outrageous
gossip, "Whig" cuts a foolish and therefore amusing figure when pitted
against the sophisticated, trenchant-minded "Tory." "Trimmer" is quite
different. L'Estrange here creates a much more intelligent opponent, one
who is given the liberty of satirizing "Observator" himself and even
patronizing him with the nickname "Nobs." Instead of naivete and obvious
stupidity, "Trimmer" has the guile and surface morality of the perfect
hypocrite, a "pretending friend" as "Observator" notes in <i>Observator</i>
III, Nos. 88 and 202. The humor in these later dialogues does not<span class="pagenum">[Pg viii]</span>
emerge from the "Trimmer" personality but from the frequent self-satire
and criticism on the part of L'Estrange. "Trimmer," for example, is
allowed to mock the prose style, figures of speech, stubbornness and
repetitiveness of "Observator," as "Trimmer's" chiding tone in
<i>Observator</i> III, No. 88 suggests. To borrow a term from Robert C.
Elliott, the entertainment of these later colloquies resides primarily
in the technique of the "satirist satirized."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> L'Estrange, in short,
creates both <i>adversariuses</i> as <i>dramatis personae</i> rather than as
simple straw men, a departure from the run-of-the-mill Restoration
dialogue evident in the following interruption of his artfully built
illusion:</p>

<blockquote><i>Obs.</i>: For Varieties sake then, we'le to work another way.
Do You keep up your Part of Trimmer still: Do Just as
you use to do; and be sure to maintain your Character;
Leave the Whig and the Tory to Me.<br>

<i>Trimmer</i>: For the Dialogue sake it shall be done.<br>

<i>Obs.</i>: But then you must Consider that there are Severall
sort of Trimmers: as your State-Trimmer, Your Law-Trimmer....<br>

<i>Trimmer</i>: And You shall Suppose Mee to be a Statesman.<br>

<i>Obs.</i>: But of what Magnitude? A Lord? A Knight?...
<br>
<i>Trimmer</i>: Why truly Nobs, if they be all of a Price, I
don't care if I be a Lord.<br>

<i>Obs.</i>: We are over that Point then; And so I am your
Lordships most Humble Servant.</blockquote>

<p>But this role playing within role playing is discarded at the end of the
paper, the role of Lord being apparently too cumbersome:</p>

<blockquote><i>Trimmer</i>: No more of your Lordships, as you love me,
Nobs; for I am e'en as weary as a Dog of my Dignity.</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(No. 242)</p>

<p>The "Character," however, is not only L'Estrange's favorite satiric tool
but perhaps the literary form most frequently used in the <i>Observator</i>.
L'Estrange himself attests to his partiality in his parting comment at
the close of the <i>Observator</i>:</p>

<blockquote><i>Obs.</i>: For my Fancy lyes more to Character, then to
Dialogue; and whoever will be so Kind as to Furnish me<span class="pagenum">[Pg ix]</span>
with Spitefull Materials, shall get his Own again with
Interest, in an Essay upon Humane Nature.</blockquote>
<p class="rtblock">(III, No. 246)</p>

<p>The Character was, of course, still highly popular in the latter half of
the century, as Chester Noyes Greenough's listings show,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> so that in
indulging his own taste, L'Estrange was also catering to the tastes of
his public. Of whatever other value the <i>Observator</i> may be to the
modern student, it is invaluable as a fine example of the
state-of-the-Character toward the end of the century. Practically every
type of Character analyzed by Benjamin Boyce in his two studies can be
found repeatedly in L'Estrange's dialogues:<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the earlier imitations
of Theophrastan Characters, with their parallelisms and antitheses; the
Overburian Character, with its extravagant metaphors; the externally
dramatized; the subjective; the sprung. There are Characters of
ideologies, of political parties, of virtues, of vices, of Whigs and
Dissenters (vices), of Tories and Anglicans (virtues). There are several
"Credo-Characters" (confessions or manifestoes), and finally there is
the habitually dramatized self-exposing Character which becomes
indistinguishable from the <i>dramatis persona</i>, as is the Character of
the Modern Whig in Nos. 13 and 110. Among the <i>Observators</i> included
here, the definition of "Dissenter" in No. 1 is based on Character
techniques, as is the conceit of the Protestant as "Adjective
Noun-Substantive" in the same number. So is also the lengthy exposure of
"Leaders" in III, No. 202, beginning with "They Talk, to the Ears, and
to the Passions of their Hearers."</p>

<p>A final comment about L'Estrange's prose, which has been variously
labeled "colloquial," "idiomatic," "vulgar," "coarse"&mdash;all vaguely
descriptive terms suggesting value judgment, and none precise enough to
give an intelligible account of what L'Estrange actually does. In
addition to the obvious device of choppy syntax and deliberately
careless constructions simulating extemporaneous speech, L'Estrange's
figures and proverbial material demonstrate his meticulous shaping of an
"applied prose"<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> particularly suitable for the audience whose
opinions he tried to sway. His metaphors and analogies tend to rely on
commonly known objects or experiences, and because of rhetorical
necessity they are almost always unpleasantly graphic. A random sampling
yielded the following results: about twenty-five percent of the figures<span class="pagenum">[Pg x]</span>
in the <i>Observator</i> deal with some specific part of the human body
(nails, spleen, mouth, eyes, ears, knees, heels, flesh, guts, belly) or
physiological processes (ulcerating, itching, chewing, digesting,
spitting, reeking, seeing, crouching, sweating, gobbling). There is no
euphemistic delicacy in these figures; L'Estrange carefully selects the
most earthy, common vehicles, thus achieving what James Sutherland has
termed "racy" and "vigorous" prose.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Another twenty-four percent of
the figures are based on common occupations, daily activities, or
objects familiar to the simpler citizen of London. These figures
ordinarily pivot on barter or trade (horse traders, hagglers, fishwives,
car men); on activities such as cooking, gambling, or glass-making; and
on such objects as clothing, bagpipes, paper-pellets, bonnets, and
chamber-pots. The rest derive from the animal kingdom, the Scriptures,
street-entertainment (jugglers, puppets, high-rope walkers) and folk
medicine (glysters and plasters). It is obvious that these
figures&mdash;their concreteness, sensuousness, and closeness to the daily
experience of the ordinary reader&mdash;are a main ingredient in the richly
colloquial texture of L'Estrange's prose, as is the proverbial material
which he incorporates unsparingly.</p>

<p>In L'Estrange's language the law of the land cannot be misunderstood,
for it calls <i>a spade a spade</i> (No. 106; T-S699).<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The factions win
their objectives <i>by hook or crook</i> (No. 100; T-H588) even though they
are as <i>mad as March Hares</i> (No. 15; T-H148) and <i>as Blind as Beetles</i>
(No. 15; T-B219). Certain things are <i>as clear as the Day</i> (No. 25;
T-D56) or <i>as plain as the nose o'my face</i> (No. 40; T-N215), whereas
others are so confused that one can <i>make neither Head nor tayl on't</i>
(No. 35; T-H258). When <i>noses are put out of joint</i> (No. 38; T-N219) and
Tories are given a <i>bone to pick</i> (No. 55; T-B522), there will obviously
be <i>no love lost betwixt</i> Whigs and Tories (No. 97; T-L544).</p>

<p>Thus L'Estrange's Characters, together with the fanciful anecdotes,
self-satire, parodies, and <i>personae</i>, provide the satire and humor in
the <i>Observator</i>, the whole being couched in familiar, pungent language.
As L'Estrange counters the faction, propagandizes, and exhorts to
rational behavior, he also amuses and delights, always hoping that the
laughter provoked by his satiric treatment will cure what he saw as
follies of his age, always appealing to the common reader whose sense<span class="pagenum">[Pg xi]</span>
of humor, he believed, was probably more developed than his sense.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Various perspectives on L'Estrange's life and works can be
found in the following: George Kitchin, <i>Sir Roger L'Estrange</i> (London,
1913) for L'Estrange's life and impact on the Restoration press; J. G.
Muddiman, <i>The King's Journalist</i> (London, 1923) for L'Estrange's
rivalry with Henry Muddiman, editor of the <i>Oxford [London] Gazette</i>;
David J. Littlefield, "The Polemic Art of Sir Roger L'Estrange: A Study

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In 1679 L'Estrange wrote six new pamphlets and reprinted
three old ones; in 1680 eleven new and seventeen old; at the start of
1681, ten new and seventeen old. A probable norm of 1000-1500 copies per
pamphlet edition has been estimated by Joseph Frank, <i>The Beginnings of
the English Newspaper, 1620-1660</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 1961), p. 314; two
orders of 1500 pamphlets each were given to the Restoration printer
Nathaniel Thompson, as noted by Leona Rostenberg, "Nathaniel Thompson,

<h2>THE<br>OBSERVATOR</h2>
<p class='larger center'>To the <i>READER</i>.</p>


<p>Most <i>Prefaces</i> are, (Effectually) <i>Apologies</i>; and neither the <i>Book</i>,
nor the <i>Author</i>, one Jot the <i>Better</i> for them. If the <i>Book</i> be
<i>Good</i>, it will not <i>Need</i> an <i>Apology</i>; If <i>Bad</i>, it will not <i>Bear</i>
One: For where a man thinks, by <i>Calling</i> himself <i>Noddy</i>, in the
<i>Epistle</i>, to <i>Atone</i>, for <i>Shewing</i> himself to be one, in the <i>Text</i>;
He does (with Respect to the Dignity of an <i>Author</i>) but <i>Bind up Two
Fools</i> in <i>One Cover</i>: But there's no more Trusting some People with
<i>Pen, Ink, and Paper</i>, then the Maddest Extravagants in <i>Bedlam</i>, with
<i>Fire</i>, <i>Sword</i>, or <i>Poyson</i>. He that <i>Writes Ill</i>, and <i>Sees</i> it, why
does he <i>Write on</i>? And, with a kind of <i>Malice Prepense, Murder</i> the
<i>Ingenious</i> part of <i>Mankind</i>? He that <i>Really Believes</i> he Writes
<i>Well</i>; why does he pretend to <i>Think</i> Otherwise? Now take it which way
you please, a man runs a Risque of his <i>Reputation</i>, for want, either of
<i>Skill</i>, and <i>Judgment</i>, the <i>One</i> way; Or of <i>Good Faith</i>, and <i>Candor</i>
the <i>Other</i>. Beside a Mighty Oversight, in <i>Imagining</i> to bring himself
off, from an <i>Ill</i> Thing, <i>Done</i>, or <i>Said</i>, by Telling the World that
he did it for <i>This</i> or <i>That Reason</i>. When a Book has once past the
<i>Press</i> into the <i>Publique</i>; there's no more <i>Recalling</i> of it, then of
a <i>Word Spoken</i>, out of the <i>Air</i> again. And a man may as well hope to
Reverse the <i>Decree</i> of his <i>Mortality</i>, as the <i>Fate</i> of his
<i>Writings</i>. In short: When the <i>Dice</i> are <i>Cast</i>, the <i>Author</i> must
stand his <i>Chance</i>.</p>

<p>Now that I may not be thought to Enterfere with my self, by <i>Declaiming</i>
against <i>One Preface</i> in <i>Another</i>: I do here previously Renounce to All
the Little Arts and Forms of Bespeaking the <i>Good Will</i> of the <i>Reader</i>;
As a <i>Practice</i>, not only <i>Mean</i>, <i>Light</i>, and <i>Unprofitable</i>; but
wholly <i>Contrary</i> to the <i>Bent</i> of <i>My Inclination</i>; as well as
<i>Inconsistent</i> with the very <i>Drift</i>, and <i>Quality</i> of my <i>Design</i>. For
These <i>Papers</i> were <i>Written</i>, Indifferently, for the <i>Enformation</i> of
the <i>Multitude</i>; and for the <i>Reproof</i> of a <i>Faction</i>: <i>Two Interests</i>
that I am not much <i>Sollicitous</i>, or <i>Ambitious</i>, to <i>Oblige</i>: And upon
<i>This Consideration</i> it is, that I have <i>Address'd</i> them to the <i>Reader</i>
in <i>Generall</i>; as a <i>Calculation</i> that will serve for <i>All Meridians</i>:
But if I could have Resolved upon a <i>Dedication</i>, with any <i>Particular
Mark</i>, or <i>Epithete</i> of <i>Distinction</i>; it should have been, <i>To the
IGNORANT, the SEDITIOUS</i>, or <i>the SCHISMATICAL Reader</i>; for <i>There</i>,
properly, lies <i>my Bus'ness</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 2]</span></p>

<p>The Reader will find in the <i>First Number</i> of This Collection, the <i>True
Intent</i>, and <i>Design</i> of the <i>Undertaking</i>; And he will likewise find,
in the very <i>Date</i> of it, (April 13. 1681.) the <i>Absolute Necessity</i> of
some Such <i>Application</i>, to Encounter the <i>Notorious Falshoods</i>; the
<i>Malicious Scandals</i>, and the <i>Poysonous Doctrines</i> of <i>That Season</i>.</p>

<p>Whether I had Sufficient <i>Ground</i>, or <i>Reason</i>, for the Warmth I have
Exprest in These Papers, upon Several Occasions, (out of an Affectionate
Sense of my <i>Duty</i>, and a <i>Zeal</i> for the <i>Peace</i>, <i>Welfare</i>, and
<i>Safety</i> of my <i>Country</i>;) I <i>Dare</i>, and I <i>Do Appeal</i> to the <i>King</i>,
and his <i>Ministers</i>; to the <i>Consciences</i> of as many of his Majesties
<i>Subjects</i>, as are not <i>Stark Blind</i> because they <i>WILL</i> not <i>See</i>; and
to the Justice of the Nation. I do <i>Appeal</i>, I say, to his Majesties
<i>Proclamations</i>; to his <i>Royal Declaration</i>; Several <i>Orders</i> of
<i>Councel</i>; the <i>Examinations</i>, and <i>Confessions</i> of <i>Unquestionable
Witnesses</i>; The <i>Solemnity</i> of so many <i>Tryals</i>, <i>Sentences</i>, and
<i>Executions</i>; and the <i>Criminals</i>, Every Man of 'em, Either
<i>Acknowledging</i> the <i>Crime</i>, or <i>Justifying</i> the <i>Treason</i>: But the
<i>FACT</i>, however made as <i>Clear</i> as the <i>Day</i>. There's the <i>Flight</i> of
the <i>Conspirators</i>; Their <i>Arms Seiz'd</i>; Their <i>Councels Laid Open</i>;
<i>Men Listed</i>; The <i>Methods</i> of the <i>Confederacy Detected</i>, to the very
<i>Time</i>, and <i>Place</i> for the <i>Perpetration</i> of the <i>Villany</i>; to the very
<i>Circumstance</i> of the <i>Providential Fire</i> at <i>Newmarket</i>, that
<i>Disappointed</i> it. I have All These <i>Demonstrative Proofs</i>, and
<i>Convincing Evidences</i>, to <i>Warrant</i> me in the most <i>Violent
Presumptions</i> of a <i>Rebellion</i> in <i>Agitation</i>: And the <i>Phanatiques
Themselves</i> made good the <i>Worst</i> Things that ever I said of the
<i>Party</i>: In <i>Vindication</i> of the <i>Importunity</i> of All my <i>Foreboding</i>,
if not <i>Prophetical Suspicions</i>: Nay, they were come to the very
<i>Point</i>, and <i>Crisis</i> of the <i>Operation</i>, of That <i>Unaccountable</i>, and
<i>Amazing Vote</i>. [<i>If his Majesty shall come by Any Violent Death (which
God Forbid) it shall</i> be <i>Reveng'd to the Utmost upon the Papists</i>.] The
<i>King</i>, and the <i>Duke</i> were to be <i>Murder'd</i> by <i>Republican</i>, and
<i>Fanatical Rebells</i>: <i>There's</i> your <i>VIOLENT DEATH</i>. And <i>Then</i>,
[Reuenge it upon the Papists:] For [<i>the Thing</i> (says <i>Keeling</i>) <i>was to
be laid upon the Papists as a Branch of the Popish Plot</i>. Walcots Tryal.
Fol.9.] And the <i>Next</i> Step was, for the <i>Traytors</i> to <i>Unriddle</i> the
<i>Mystery</i>, and to <i>Expound</i>, Who were the <i>Papists</i>. [<i>The Lord Mayor,
and the Sheriffs</i>] <i>were Three</i> of 'em. <i>They</i>, were to be Kill'd; And<span class="pagenum">[Pg 3]</span>
[<i>as many of the</i> Lieutenancy <i>as they could get; And the Principal
Ministers of State; My Lord</i> Halifax, <i>My Lord</i> Rochester, <i>and my</i> Lord
Keeper: (<i>They</i> were <i>Three Papists more</i>.) <i>My Lord</i> Keeper <i>was to
have been</i> Hang'd <i>upon the same Post that</i> College <i>had hung. Sir</i> John
Moor <i>to be</i> Hung-up <i>in</i> Guildhall, <i>as a Betrayer of the Rights and
Liberties of the City. And the Judges Lordships to be</i> Flay'd, <i>and</i>
Stuff'd, <i>and</i> Hung-up <i>in</i> Westminster Hall: <i>And a great many of the</i>
Pensionary Parliament Hang'd-up, <i>as Betrayers of the Rights of the
People</i>. Walcots Tryal, p. 15.] You have here, a <i>Practical Explanation</i>
of the <i>True-Protestant Way</i>, (in case of <i>the King's Violent Death</i>)
<i>of Revenging it to the Utmost upon the Papists</i>. And This Intended
<i>Assassination</i> (says <i>Ferguson</i> (in the same Page)) [<i>Is a Glorious
Action, and such an Action as</i> I HOPE TO SEE PUBLIQUELY GRATIFY'D BY
PARLIAMENT; <i>And Question not but you will be Fam'd for it, and</i> Statues
<i>Erected for you, with the Title of</i> LIBERATORES PATRIAE. <i>Ibid.</i>] Now
when Matters were come to <i>This Pass</i> once, I think it was High Time to
Write <i>Observators</i>.</p>

<p>I might Enlarge my self, upon the <i>Inducements</i> that Mov'd me to Enter
upon This <i>Province</i>; The <i>Needfullness</i> of some <i>Popular Medium</i> for
the <i>Rectifying</i> of <i>Vulgar Mistakes,</i> and for <i>Instilling</i> of
<i>Dutyfull</i>, and <i>Honest Principles</i> into the <i>Common People</i>, upon That
<i>Turbulent</i>, and <i>Seditious Juncture</i>: But I am not Willing to <i>Clogg</i>
my <i>Preface</i>, with the <i>Repetition</i> of what I have spoken so <i>Expressly</i>
to, in the <i>Book</i>.</p>

<p>I am now to Advertise the <i>Reader</i>, in the next Place; That as I have
not Strain'd, so much as <i>One Syllable</i>, in the <i>Whole Course</i> of <i>These
Papers</i>, beyond the <i>Line</i> of <i>Truth</i>, Nor let fall <i>One Word, Contrary</i>
to my <i>Conscience</i>; Nor <i>Layd-on</i> so much as <i>One False Colour</i>, for a
<i>Blind</i>, or a <i>Disguise</i>: As I have not done any Thing of All This, I
say; Nor <i>Gratify'd</i> so much as <i>One Passion</i> to the Prejudice, of any
<i>MAN</i>, or <i>THING</i>; or of <i>Common Justice it Self</i>: So neither, on the
<i>Other</i> hand, was I less <i>Cautious</i>, and <i>Considerate</i>, in the
<i>Undertaking</i> of This <i>Duty</i>, then I have been <i>Clear</i>, and <i>Impartial</i>,
in the <i>Discharge</i>, and <i>Manage</i> of it.</p>

<p>I was no sooner Possess't, of the <i>Reason</i>, and the <i>Expedience</i> of the
<i>Thing</i>; but I fell presently to <i>Deliberate</i> upon the <i>Invidious
Difficulties</i>; The <i>Scandals</i>, <i>Reproches</i>, and a Thousand Other
<i>Mischiefs</i>, and <i>Inconveniencies</i>, that would probably <i>Attend</i> it. I<span class="pagenum">[Pg 4]</span>
laid them All <i>before</i> me; And upon a <i>Full Computation</i> of the <i>Matter,
Pro</i> and <i>Con</i>; I Resolv'd, at last, to Put <i>pen to paper</i>; not without
some <i>Vanity</i> perhaps, in <i>Affecting</i> the <i>Honour</i> of being <i>Revil'd</i>,
by the <i>Blasphemers</i> of <i>God</i>, and the <i>King</i>. I shall say Nothing of
the <i>Traytors</i>; The <i>Papists</i>; The <i>Fidlers</i>; The
<i>All-manner-of-Rogues</i>, and <i>Debauchees</i> that they have <i>made</i> me: For
their <i>Cause</i> is <i>Founded</i> upon a <i>Sacrilegious Hypocrisy; Maintain'd</i>
by <i>Fraud</i>, <i>Scandal</i>, and <i>Imposture</i>. And when they have a mind to
<i>Blacken</i> a man, 'tis not a <i>Straw</i> matter, for any <i>Foundation</i> of
<i>Fact</i>, or <i>History</i>: But <i>Paint</i> him as like the <i>Devil</i> as they <i>Can</i>;
and to make short Work on't, <i>One Fanatique</i> Sits to <i>Another</i>, for the
<i>Picture</i>. But <i>These Scurrilities</i> have more of <i>Noise</i> in 'em, then of
<i>Weight</i>: And Those People that had the face to <i>Calumniate Charles the
First</i>, for a <i>TYRANT</i>, and a <i>PAPIST</i>; And the <i>Confidence</i>, at This
very day, to do as much for <i>Charles the Second</i>; They that <i>Preach
REBELLION</i> out of the <i>GOSPEL</i>; Give it the <i>Name</i> of <i>GOD'S TRUTH,
GOD'S CAUSE</i>; And offer up the <i>Bloud</i> of <i>Kings</i> as an <i>Acceptable
Sacrifice</i> to <i>Jesus Christ</i>: What <i>Christian</i> will not <i>Value</i> himself,
upon the <i>Reputation</i> of lying under the <i>Scourge</i> of <i>Those Tongues</i>,
and <i>Pens</i>, that Offer these <i>Outrages</i> to their <i>Maker</i>, and their
<i>Saviour</i>? So that these <i>Clamours</i>, and <i>Maledictions</i>, I look upon, as
Matter, rather of <i>Advantage</i>, then <i>Discredit</i>; Where <i>Loyalty</i> to the
<i>King</i>, and to the <i>Church</i>, is made the <i>Crime</i>: But yet I must
Confess, I had <i>Some Other Mortifications</i> in my <i>Thought</i>, that went a
little <i>Nearer</i> me.</p>

<p>As first, the <i>Indecency</i> of a <i>Gentlemans</i> Entring into a
<i>Street-Brawl</i>, (and <i>Bare-fac'd</i> too) with the <i>Sink</i> of <i>Mankind</i>,
both for <i>Quality</i>, and <i>Wickedness</i>. 21y. The <i>Disproportion</i>, and the
<i>Indecorum</i> of the Thing, for an <i>Old Fellow</i> that now Writes <i>Sixty
Eight</i>, to run about, a <i>Masquerading</i>, and <i>Dialoguing</i> of it, in
<i>Twenty Fantastical Shapes</i>, only to furnish a <i>Popular Entertainment</i>,
and <i>Diversion</i>. 31y. The <i>Scandalous Appearance</i> of it, for Me to take
up the <i>Profession</i>, and <i>Bus'ness</i> of a <i>Pamphleteer</i>; And (almost) to
Lose the <i>Name</i> of my <i>Family</i>, by it, in <i>Exchange</i> for That of the
<i>Observator</i>. 41y. I had This Prospect before me too. What
<i>Construction</i> would be made upon't; (If I may speak it with <i>Modesty</i>)
even to the <i>Lessening</i> of my <i>Character</i>; And Consequently, to my
Detriment, Every way, as well in Respect of <i>Fortune</i>, as <i>Esteem</i>: For
men are apt, in such Cases as This, to <i>Mistake</i>, the <i>Intent</i>, as well<span class="pagenum">[Pg 5]</span>
as the <i>Reason</i> of the <i>Office</i>; and to Impute the most <i>Sacred</i>, and
<i>Consciencious Zeal</i> of an <i>Upright Heart</i>, in the performance of the
most <i>Important</i>, and <i>Necessary Duty</i>, only to a <i>Levity</i> of <i>Mind</i>,
perchance; Or in Other Terms; to an Over <i>Officious</i>, and <i>Pragmatical
Itch of Medling</i>: It makes a man to be lookt upon, as if a <i>Pamphlet</i>
were his <i>Masterpiece</i>; and when he's once <i>Nail'd</i> to <i>That Post</i>, he
may reckon upon't, that he's at the <i>Top</i> of his <i>Preferment</i>. Upon
These <i>Four Difficulties</i>, I Reason'd with my self, after This Manner.
To the <i>First</i>; What do I care, for having so much <i>Dirt</i> Thrown at me,
that will <i>Wash off</i> again? And at the worst, the Engaging with such a
<i>Rabble</i> of <i>Contaminated Varlets</i>, is no more then <i>Leaping</i> into the
<i>Mud</i> to help my <i>Father. Secondly. 'Tis not for a man in years</i>, to do
so and so. Well! And here's a <i>Reputative Circumstance</i>, on the <i>One</i>
hand, against an <i>Indispensable Duty</i>, on the <i>Other</i>. The <i>Common
people</i> are <i>Poyson'd</i>, and will run <i>Stark Mad</i>, if they be not
<i>Cur'd</i>: Offer them <i>Reason</i>, without <i>Fooling</i>, and it will never
<i>Down</i> with them: And give them <i>Fooling</i>, without <i>Argument</i>, they're
never the <i>Better</i> for't. Let 'em <i>Alone</i>, and All's <i>Lost</i>. So that the
<i>Mixture</i> is become as <i>Necessary</i>, as the <i>Office</i>; And it has been <i>My
Part</i>, only to <i>Season</i> the <i>One</i> with the <i>Other. Thirdly</i>, I must Set
the <i>Conscience</i> of the Action, against the <i>Reproch</i>. And <i>Lastly; 'Tis
nothing to me what Other People</i> Think, <i>so long as I am Conscious to my
Self that I Do what I</i> Ought.</p>

<p>All This I Computed upon, <i>before-hand</i>; And thus far, I have not been
<i>Deceiv'd</i> in my <i>Account</i>. I have been <i>Baited</i> with <i>Thousands</i> upon
<i>Thousands</i> of <i>Libells</i>. I have Created <i>Enemies</i> that do me the
<i>Honour</i> to <i>Hate</i> me, perhaps, next to the <i>King Himself</i> (God Bless
him) and the <i>Royal Family</i>. Their <i>Scandals</i> are <i>Blown over</i>: Their
<i>Malice, Defeated</i>, And whenever <i>my Hour comes</i>, I am ready to Deliver
up my <i>Soul</i>, with the <i>Conscience</i> of an <i>Honest Man</i>, as to what I
have done, in <i>This Particular</i>: And I do here Declare, in the
<i>Presence</i> of an <i>All-Seeing</i>, and an <i>All-Knowing God</i>, That as I have
never yet receiv'd any <i>Answer</i>, more then <i>Cavil</i>, and <i>Shuffling</i>, to
the <i>Doctrine</i>, and <i>Reasoning</i> of <i>These Papers</i>: So I never <i>made use</i>
of Any <i>Sophism</i>, or <i>Double Meaning</i>, in Defence of the <i>Cause</i> that I
have here taken upon me to <i>Assert</i>: But have dealt <i>Plainly</i>, and
<i>Above-Bord</i>, without either <i>Fallacy</i>, or <i>Collusion</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>After This <i>View</i> of the <i>Worst side</i> of my <i>Case</i>; (And (in truth) a
kind of <i>Abstract</i> of it, in <i>Minutes</i>) I should be Extremely wanting,
both to <i>God</i> and <i>Man</i>, in not taking <i>This Occasion</i>, of making
<i>known</i> to the <i>world</i>, the <i>Many Generous Instances</i> of <i>Affection</i>,
and <i>Respect</i>, which I have received, not only from the most
<i>Considerable</i> Part of his Majesties <i>Loyal Subjects</i> of <i>All
Qualities</i>, and <i>Degrees</i>; But <i>Particularly</i> from the <i>Two Famous
Universities Themselves</i>: And, in short, from the most <i>Eminent Persons</i>
of the <i>Long Robe</i>, in their <i>Several Professions</i>: In <i>Testimony</i> of
their <i>Favourable Acceptance</i> of my <i>Honest Endeavours</i> toward the
Service, both of the <i>Church</i>, &amp; the <i>State</i>. And This I am Obliged to
leave behind me, upon <i>Record</i>; out of a <i>Double Right</i>, &amp; <i>Regard</i>, as
well to my <i>Friends</i>, as to my <i>Self</i>: For I reckon upon it, as an
<i>Accumulation</i> of <i>Honour</i>, to <i>Me</i>, to be <i>Rescu'd</i> out of the hands of
<i>Publique Enemies</i>, and <i>Apostates</i>, by Men of the Clear <i>Contrary
Character</i>; That is to say; by Men of <i>Unquestionable Integrity</i>, and of
<i>Unspotted Faith</i>.</p>

<p>My <i>Back Friends</i> are as <i>Merry</i>, now, as <i>a Laugh on One side of the
Mouth</i> can Make 'em; at the <i>Conceit</i> of calling the several <i>Presents</i>
which have been made me (and they are very <i>Considerable</i>) by the name
of a <i>Gathering</i>; and they do not Stick to put it about, That I was my
<i>Own Sollicitor</i> for the <i>Begging</i> of it. I have been Told of One, that
<i>said</i> as much; <i>for whose sake</i>, I would Advise <i>All Parents</i> to take
it for a <i>Warning</i>, not to <i>Stuff</i> their <i>Childrens Heads</i> so Damnably,
with <i>Greek and Latin</i>, as to leave no <i>Room</i> for <i>Brains</i>, and <i>Good
Manners</i>. But what if it <i>be a Gathering</i>? Are not All <i>Publique
Benevolences; Publique Works; Publique Acknowledgments</i>; the <i>same
Thing</i>? Neither do I find any more <i>Scandal</i>, in receiving a <i>Reward</i>
for a <i>Service</i> in a <i>Common Cause</i>, then in a <i>Lawyers</i> taking a <i>Fee</i>,
in a <i>Private</i> One: But be it what it <i>will</i>: I shall Transmit the
<i>Acknowledgment</i> of it, with This Paper, as the <i>Glory of my Life</i>: And
Value my self Incomparably more upon so <i>Eminent</i> a <i>Mark</i> of a <i>General
Esteem</i>; then upon the <i>Advantage</i> of <i>Ten times a Greater Sum</i>, by <i>Any
Other way</i>. But <i>Gatherings</i>, with some People, are only <i>Honourable</i>,
when they are Apply'd to the <i>Maintaining</i> of <i>Conspirators</i>, and
<i>Affidavit-Men</i>: And they Account <i>Money</i> much better <i>Bestow'd</i> upon
the <i>Subversion</i> of the <i>Government</i>, then toward the <i>Defending</i> of it:
But <i>That Orange is Squeez'd as far as 'twill Drop, already</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Now to the <i>Calumny</i> of <i>My Setting This Bus'ness afoot; First</i>, I thank
God, that neither my <i>Mind</i>, nor my <i>Condition</i> were ever Sunk <i>so</i> Low,
yet, as to <i>Descend</i> to <i>That way of Application</i>. 21y, As I hope to be
Sav'd, the Matter was Proceeded upon, in <i>Several Places</i>, and a <i>Long
Time</i>, before ever I had the Least <i>Inkling</i>, or <i>Imagination</i> of it;
And when it was so far <i>Advanc'd, without my Privity</i>, I must Certainly
have been both a Great <i>Fool</i>, and a Great <i>Clown</i>, either to have
<i>Oppos'd</i>, or <i>Refus'd</i>, a Token of so <i>Obliging</i>, and so <i>Generous</i> a
<i>Respect</i>. To Conclude; If any man has been so <i>Misled</i>, as to <i>Intend</i>
That for a <i>Personal Charity</i>; which I cannot <i>Honourably</i> Own the
<i>Receiving</i> of, under <i>That Notion</i>; I am ready to Return him his
Proportion, with a Thousand Acknowledgments: But This shall not Hinder
me yet, from <i>Cherishing</i> in my <i>Thoughts</i>, the <i>Remembrance</i> of what
<i>Honour</i> soever has been done me for the sake of the <i>Publique</i>.</p>

<p>The Reflexions that have been Pass'd upon my <i>Quality</i>, and
<i>Conversation</i>, need no Further Answer, then to Appeal to my very
<i>Name</i>, and my <i>Acquaintance</i>: But for the <i>Charge</i> of being a <i>Papist</i>,
it is as <i>False</i>, as it is <i>Malicious</i>.</p>

<p>I am to say One Word more now, concerning my <i>L. Shaftsbury</i>; whose
<i>Name</i>, and <i>Title</i>, I have often Occasion to make mention of, in This
Book. The <i>Reader</i> is to take Notice, that it is Intended of the <i>Late
Earl of Shaftsbury</i>, who Dy'd at <i>Amsterdam, Jan. 168-2/3. The Surviving
Heir of That Honour, and Family, having ever Demean'd himself with a
Remarkable Loyalty, and Respect, toward the King, and his Government</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<h2>THE<br>OBSERVATOR.</h2>

<h3>In <i>QUESTION</i> and <i>ANSWER</i>.</h3>
<hr style="width: 95%;">
<p class='center'><b>WEDNESDAY</b>, April 13. 1681.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">


<p><i>Q. WEll! They are so. But do you think now to bring'um to their Wits
again with a</i> Pamphlet?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Come, Come; 'Tis the <i>Press</i> that has made'um <i>Mad</i>, and the
<i>Press</i> must set'um <i>Right</i> again. The Distemper is <i>Epidemical</i>; and
there's no way in the world, but by <i>Printing</i>, to convey the <i>Remedy</i>
to the <i>Disease</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But what is it that you call a</i> Remedy?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The <i>Removing</i> of the <i>Cause</i>. That is to say, the <i>Undeceiving</i> of
the <i>People</i>: for they are well enough Disposed, of themselves, to be
Orderly, and Obedient; if they were not misled by <i>Ill Principles</i>, and
Hair'd and Juggled out of their Senses with so many Frightful <i>Stories</i>
and <i>Impostures</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Well! to be Plain and Short; You call your self the</i> Observator:
<i>What is it now that you intend for the Subject of your</i> Observations?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Take it in few words then. My business is, to encounter the
<i>Faction</i>, and to Vindicate the <i>Government</i>; to detect their
<i>Forgeries</i>; to lay open the Rankness of their <i>Calumnies</i>, and
<i>Malice</i>; to Refute their <i>Seditious Doctrines</i>; to expose their
<i>Hypocrisy</i>, and the <i>bloudy Design</i> that is carry'd on, under the Name,
and Semblance, of <i>Religion</i>; And, in short, to lift up the Cloke of the
<i>True Protestant</i> (as he Christens himself) and to shew the People, the
<i>Jesuite</i> that lies skulking under it.</p>

<p><i>Q. Shall the</i> Observator <i>be a</i> Weekly Paper, <i>or How</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, No; but oftner, or seldomer, as I see Occasion.</p>

<p><i>Q. Pray favour me a word; When you speak of a</i> True Protestant,
<i>don't you mean a</i> Dissenting Protestant?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, I do: For your <i>Assenting</i> and <i>Consenting Protestant</i> (you
must know) is a <i>Christian</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p><i>Q. And is not a</i> Dissenting Protestant <i>a</i> Christian too?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Peradventure, he <i>is</i> one; peradventure, <i>not</i>: For a <i>Dissenter</i>
has his Name from his <i>Disagreement</i>, not from his <i>Perswasion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. What is a Dissenter then?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Tis Impossible to say either what a <i>Dissenter IS</i>, or what he is
<i>NOT</i>. For he's a <i>NOTHING</i>; that may yet come to be <i>ANY thing</i>. He may
be a <i>Christian</i>; or he may be a <i>Turk</i>; But you'l find the best account
of him in his <i>Name</i>. <i>A DISSENTER, is one that thinks OTHERWISE.</i> That
is to say, let the <i>Magistrate</i> think what he pleases, the <i>Dissenter</i>
will be sure to be of <i>another Opinion</i>. A <i>Dissenter</i> is not of <i>This</i>,
or of <i>That</i>, or of <i>Any Religion</i>; but <i>A Member Politique of an
Incorporate Faction</i>: or Otherwise; A <i>Protestant-Fault-Finder</i> in a
<i>Christian Commonwealth</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Well! but tho' a</i> Dissenter <i>may be</i> any thing; <i>A</i> Dissenting
Protestant <i>yet tells ye</i> what <i>he Is</i>.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He does so, he tells ye that he <i>is</i> a <i>Negative</i>: an
<i>Anti-Protester</i>; One that <i>Protests AGAINST</i>, but not <i>FOR</i> any thing.</p>

<p><i>Q. Ay; but so long as he opposes the</i> Corruptions <i>of the Church of</i>
Rome.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well: And so he does the <i>Rites</i>, and <i>Constitutions</i> of the Church
of <i>England</i> too. As a <i>Protestant</i>, he does the <i>former</i>; and the
<i>Other</i> as a <i>Dissenter</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But is there no</i> Uniting <i>of These</i> Dissenters?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> You shall as soon make the Winds blow the same way, from all the
Poynts of the Compass.</p>

<p><i>Q. There are</i> Good <i>and</i> Bad, <i>of</i> all Opinions, <i>there's no doubt
on't: But do you think it fayr, to Condemn a</i> whole Party <i>for some</i> Ill
men <i>in't</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, by no means: The <i>Party</i> is neither the <i>Worse</i>, for having
<i>Ill</i> men in it, nor the <i>Better</i>, for <i>Good</i>. For whatever the
<i>Members</i> are, the <i>Party</i> is a <i>Confederacy</i>; as being a <i>Combination</i>,
against the <i>Law</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But a man may</i> Mean honestly, <i>and yet perhaps ly under some</i>
Mistake. <i>Can any man help his Opinion?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> A man may <i>Mean well</i>, and <i>Do Ill</i>; he may shed <i>Innocent Bloud</i>,
and <i>think he does God good Service</i>. 'Tis True: A man cannot help
<i>Thinking</i>; but he may help <i>Doing</i>: He is <i>Excusable</i> for a <i>Private</i>
Mistake, for <i>That's</i> an Error only to <i>himself</i>; but when it comes<span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
once to an <i>Overt Act</i>, 'tis an <i>Usurpation</i> upon the <i>Magistrate</i>, and
there's no Plea for't.</p>

<p><i>Q. You have no kindnesse, I perceive, for a</i> Dissenting Protestant;
<i>but what do you think of a bare</i> Protestant <i>without any</i> Adjunct?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I do look upon <i>Such</i> a <i>Protestant</i> to be a kind of an <i>Adjective
Noun-Substantive; It requires something to be joyn'd with it, to shew
its Signification</i>. By <i>Protestancy</i> in <i>General</i> is commonly understood
a <i>Separation</i> of Christians from the Communion of the Church of <i>Rome</i>:
But to <i>Oppose Errors</i>, on the <i>One hand</i>, is not Sufficient, without
keeping our selves <i>Clear</i> of Corruptions, on the <i>Other</i>. Now it was
the <i>Reformation</i>, not the <i>Protestation</i>, that Settled us upon a <i>true
Medium</i> betwixt the two <i>Extreams</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. So that you look upon the</i> Protestation, <i>and the</i> Reformation,
<i>it seems, as two several things</i>.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Very right; But in such a manner only, that the <i>Former</i>, by Gods
Providence, made way for the <i>Other</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But are not all</i> Protestants <i>Members of the</i> Reformed Religion?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Take notice, <i>First</i>, that the <i>Name</i> came Originally from the
<i>Protestation</i> in 1529. against the <i>Decree of Spires</i>; and that the
<i>Lutheran Protestants</i> and <i>Ours</i> of the Church of <i>England</i>, are not of
the <i>Sam Communion</i>. Now <i>Secondly</i>; If you take <i>Protestants</i> in the
<i>Latitude</i> with our <i>Dissenters</i>, they are not so much a <i>Religion</i>, as
a <i>Party</i>; and whoever takes this Body of <i>Dissenters</i> for <i>Members</i> of
the <i>Reformed Religion</i> sets up a <i>Reformation</i> of a <i>hundred and fifty
Colours</i> and as may [sic] <i>Heresies</i>. The <i>Anabaptists, Brownists,
Antinomians, Familists, &amp;c.</i> do all of them set up for <i>Dissenting
Protestants</i>; but God forbid we should ever enter these <i>People</i> upon
the Roll of the <i>Reformation</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Well! <i>but what do you think of</i> Protestant Smith <i>and</i> Protestant
Harris?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Just as I do of <i>Protestant Muncer</i>, and <i>Protestant Phifer</i>; a
Brace of <i>Protestants</i> that cost the Empire 150000 Lives: and our own
<i>Pretended Protestants</i> too, of Later Date, have cost <i>This Nation
little lesse</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Ay: But these are men of quite another Temper: Do not you see how
zealous they are for the Preservation of the</i> King's Person, <i>the</i>
Government, <i>and the</i> Protestant Religion?</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> I <i>See</i> well enough what they <i>Say</i>, and I <i>know</i> what they <i>do</i>.
Consider, <i>First</i>, that they are Profess'd <i>Anabaptists: Smith</i> no less
then a <i>pretended Prophet</i>; and the <i>Other</i>, a kind of a <i>Wet
Enthusiast. Secondly</i>; 'tis the very <i>Doctrine</i> of the <i>Sect</i> to root
out <i>Magistracy</i>, Cancel <i>Humane Laws; Kill</i>, and take <i>Possession</i>; and
<i>wash their Feet with the Bloud of the Ungodly</i>; and where ever they
have set Footing, they have <i>Practic'd</i> what they <i>Taught</i>. Are not
these likely men now, to help out a <i>King</i>, and a <i>Religion</i>, at a dead
lift? If you would be further satisfy'd in the Truth of things, reade
<i>Sleidan, Spanhemius, Gastius, Hortensius, Bullinger, Pontanus, The
Dipper dipp'd, Bayly's Disswasive, Pagets Heresiography</i>, &amp;c.
<i>Hortensius</i> tells ye, how <i>Jack of Leydens Successor</i> murthered his
Wife, to make way to his Daughter, <i>P.</i> 74. and after that, cut a girls
throat, for fear she should tell Tales. <i>Gastius</i> tells us of a Fellow
that cut off his brothers Head, as by Impulse, and then cry'd, <i>The Will
of God is fulfilled, lib. I. Pa. 12. Jack of Leyden</i> started up from
Supper, <i>to do some business</i> (he said) <i>which the Father had commanded
him</i>, and cut off a Soldiers Head; and afterwards cut off his Wives head
in the <i>Market-place. Sleydans Comment. Lib. 10.</i></p>

<p><i>Q. You will not make the</i> Protestant-Mercury <i>to be an</i> Anabaptist
<i>too, will ye</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If you do make him <i>any thing</i>, I'le make him <i>That</i>. But in one
word, they are <i>Factious</i> and <i>Necessitous</i>; and consequently, the
fittest Instruments in the world, for the Promoting of a <i>Sedition</i>.
First, as they are <i>Principled</i> for't; and then, in respect of their
<i>Condition</i>; for they are every man of them under the Lash of the Law,
and Retainers to Prisons; So that in their <i>Fortunes</i> they can hardly be
<i>worse</i>. Insomuch, that it is a common thing for them to lend a Name to
the countenancing of a Libel which no body else dares own.</p>

<p><i>Q. Well! but let them be as</i> poor, <i>and</i> malicious <i>as</i> Devils, <i>so
long as they have neither</i> Brains, <i>nor</i> Interest, <i>what hurt can their
Papers do</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The Intelligences, you must know, that bear their <i>Names</i>, are not
of <i>their Composing</i>, but the Dictates of a <i>Faction</i>, and the Venom of
a Club of <i>Common-wealths-men</i> instill'd into those Papers.</p>

<p><i>Q. These are</i> Words, <i>all this while, without</i> Proofs; <i>Can you shew
us particularly where the Venom lies?</i></p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> It is the business of every Sheet they Publish, to Affront the
<i>Government</i>, the <i>Kings Authority</i>, and <i>Administration</i>; the
<i>Privy-Council</i>; the <i>Church, Bench, Juries, Witnesses</i>; All <i>Officers,
Ecclesiastical, Military</i>, and <i>Civil</i>: and no matter for <i>Truth</i> or
<i>Honesty</i>, when a <i>Forg'd Relation</i> will serve their turn. 'Tis a common
thing with them, to get half a dozen <i>Schismaticall</i> Hands to a
<i>Petition</i>, or <i>Address</i> in a corner, and then call it, the sense of the
Nation: and when all's done, they are not above twenty Persons, that
make all this Clutter in the Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Q. But to what End do they all this?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> To make the Government <i>Odious</i>, and <i>Contemptible</i>; to magnifie
their own Party; and fright the People out of their <i>Allegeance</i>, by
<i>Counterfeit Letters, Reports</i>, and <i>false Musters</i>, as if the sober and
considerable part of the Nation were all on their side.</p>

<p><i>Q. We are in Common Charity to</i> allow, <i>for</i> Errors, <i>and</i>
Mis-reports, <i>and not presently to make an Act of</i> Malice, <i>and</i>
Design, <i>out of every</i> Mistake. <i>Can you shew me any of these</i>
Counterfeits, <i>and</i> Impostures <i>that you speak of? These</i> Cheats <i>upon
the</i> People, <i>and</i> Affronts <i>upon the</i> Government?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, yes; Abundantly. And Il'e give you Instances immediately upon
every poynt you'l ask me: Only This note, by the way; That let them be
<i>mistakes</i>, or <i>Contrivances</i>, or what you will, they all run
Unanimously <i>against</i> the Government, without so much as one Syllable in
<i>favour</i> of it: Which makes the matter desperately suspitious.</p>

<p><i>Q. Let me see then, in the First place, where any</i> Affront <i>is put
upon the</i> Government.</p>

<p><i>A. Some Persons</i> (Says Smiths Prot. Int. N. 7.) <i>in</i> Norwich, <i>&amp;c.
who have a greater stock of</i> Confidence, <i>and</i> Malice, <i>then</i> Wisdom,
<i>and</i> Honesty, <i>are so far transported with</i> Zeal <i>to serve the</i> Devil,
<i>or his</i> Emissaryes <i>the</i> Papists, <i>that they are now Prosecuting
several</i> Dissenting Protestants <i>upon</i> Stat. 35. Eliz. <i>&amp;c.</i> (And so the
Protestant-Mercury, <i>N.</i> 15.) <i>Some People at</i> Norwich, <i>are playing
the</i> Devil <i>for</i> Godsake: <i>several honest, peaceable</i>, Protestant
Dissenters, <i>having been troubled for not coming to</i> Church, <i>or having
been Present at</i> Religious Meetings &amp;c. Now what greater <i>Affront</i> can
there be to <i>Government</i>, then This language, <i>First</i>, from an
<i>Anabaptist</i> that is a <i>Professed Enemy</i> to <i>all Government</i>; and<span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
<i>Secondly</i>, from a <i>Private Person</i>, Bare-fac'd, to arraign a <i>Solemn
Law</i>: A <i>Law</i> of this <i>Antiquity</i>; a <i>Law</i> of <i>Queen Elizabeth's</i>, (a
Princesse so much Celebrated by our <i>Dissenters themselves</i> for her
<i>Piety, Good Government</i>, and <i>Moderation</i>;) a <i>Law</i> which, upon
Experience, has been found so <i>Necessary</i>, that the bare <i>Relaxing</i> of
it, cost the <i>Life</i> of a <i>Prince</i>, the <i>Bloud</i> of <i>two or three hundred
thousand</i> of his <i>Subjects</i>, and a <i>Twenty-years-Rebellion</i>? To say
nothing of the dangerous Consequence of making it <i>Unsafe</i> for
<i>Magistrates</i> to discharge their Dutyes, for fear of <i>Outrages</i>, and
<i>Libells</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Well! but what have you to say now to the</i> Kings Authority, <i>his</i>
Administration, <i>and his</i> Privy Council.</p>

<p><i>A. Smith</i> (in his <i>Vox Populi, P.</i> 13.) saith, that <i>the King is
oblig'd to pass or Confirm those Laws his People shall Chuse</i>, at which
rate, if they shall tender him a Bill for the <i>Deposing</i> of himself, he
is bound to <i>agree</i> to't. <i>Secondly</i>, in the same Page, <i>he Denies the
Kings Power of Proroguing, or Dissolving Parliaments</i>; which is an
<i>Essential</i> of <i>Government</i> it self, under what Form soever, and he's no
longer a <i>King, without it</i>. And then for his <i>Administration, P.</i> 1.
the <i>Anabaptist</i> charges upon his Majesty [<i>those many surprizing and
astonishing Prorogations, and Dissolutions</i> (as he has worded his
Meaning) <i>to be procur'd by the Papists</i>.] And then, <i>P.</i> 15. he wounds
both the <i>King</i>, and his <i>Council</i>, at a Blow; in falling upon <i>those
that make the King break his Coronation-Oath</i>; arraigning his <i>Council</i>
in the <i>First</i> place, and the <i>King himself</i> in the <i>Second</i>; and that
for no less then the breach of <i>Oath</i>, and <i>Faith</i>.&mdash;&mdash;Wee'l talk out
the Rest at our next Meeting.</p>

<h2>THE<br>OBSERVATOR.</h2>

<h3>In <i>QUESTION</i> and <i>ANSWER</i>.</h3>
<hr style="width: 95%;">
<p class='center'><b>SATURDAY</b>, May 14. 1681.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">

<p><i>Q</i>. <i>But which way lies</i> your <i>Humour</i> then?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> My way (you must know) lies more to <i>History</i>, and <i>Books</i>, and
<i>Politicks</i>, and <i>Religion</i>, and <i>such as That</i>, But take this along
with you too; that I am for turning over of <i>Men</i>, as well as <i>Books</i>;
for that's the Profitable Study when all's done.</p>

<p><i>Q. Pre' thee commend me to the</i> Common Hangman <i>then, If He that</i>
turns over <i>the most</i> men <i>be the</i> Greatest Philosopher. <i>But how</i>
turning over <i>of</i> Men?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That is to say, I <i>Read</i> Them; I <i>Study</i> them; I speak of <i>turning
over</i> their <i>Actions</i>, not their <i>Bodys</i>. And Pray observe my <i>Simile.
Every</i> Action <i>of a mans</i> Life <i>resembles</i> a Page <i>in a</i> Book. D'ye Mark
me?</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> I <i>were to Blame else, But what are the Authors that you would
recommend to a bodys Reading?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why thereafter as the Subject is, As for <i>History</i>; ye have <i>Clarks
Lives</i>, and <i>Examples</i>; <i>Lloyd's Memoirs</i>; the <i>Popes Warehouse</i>, &amp;c.
For <i>Politicks</i>; There's Mr. <i>Baxters Holy Commonwealth</i>, the <i>Assemblys
Catechism</i>, The Letter about the <i>Black Box</i>, &amp;c. For <i>Law</i>, ye have Mr.
<i>Prinn's Soveraign Power of Parliaments</i>; <i>Smiths Vox Populi</i>, &amp;c. For
<i>Morals</i>, There's <i>Youth's Behaviour</i>; And then For <i>Deep Knowledge</i>, ye
have <i>Brightman's Revelations Reveal'd</i>; <i>Lilly's Hieroglyphicks</i>; the
<i>Northern Star</i>, <i>Jones</i> of the <i>Heart</i>: All Excellent Pieces in their
kinds, and not Inferior (perhaps) to any of the Ancients.</p>

<p><i>Q. I was never so happy as to meet with any of these Authors. But
what d'ye think of</i> Cornelius Tacitus?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A <i>Talking, Tedious, Empty Fellow</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Well but is not</i> Titus Livius <i>a pretty Good</i> Historian?</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ha Ha Ha. That Same <i>Titus</i> is an Errant <i>Puppy</i>, A <i>Damn'd,
Insipid, Lying Coxcomb. Titus Livius</i> a good <i>Historian</i> sayst thou? Why
if I had a <i>Schoolboy</i> that writ such <i>Latin</i> I'de tickle his <i>Toby</i> for
him.</p>

<p><i>Q. But what's your Opinion of</i> Caesars Commentaries <i>then? I mean,
for a</i> Narrative?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A <i>Narrative</i> d'ye say? Deliver me from such <i>Narratives</i>! Why 'tis
no more to be compar'd to the <i>Narratives</i> that are written <i>now adays</i>,
then an <i>Apple</i> is to an <i>Oyster</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But however He was a very</i> Brave Fellow, <i>was he not</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> He was an <i>Arbitrary</i>, Oppressing, Tyrannical <i>Fellow</i>. And then
for his <i>Bravery</i>, he did pretty well at the Battel of <i>Leipsick</i>, and
after that, at <i>Lepanto</i>; and when you have said that, you have said
all.</p>

<p><i>Q. You have read all these Authors, have you not?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why verily I <i>have</i>, and I have <i>not</i>. They are a company of
<i>Lying, Ridiculing Rascals</i>; They do not <i>AFFECT</i> me at all: they are
below me, they are not worth my notice.</p>

<p><i>Q. What would I give to be as well vers'd in</i> History, <i>as you are</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And that's Impossible, let me tell ye; Utterly Impossible: For I
reade just six times as much as any other Man. I have Read more
<i>Folio's</i> then ever <i>Tostatus</i> read <i>Pages</i>. In one Word; I reade as
much in <i>one hour</i>, as any other man reads in <i>six</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why how can that be?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why you must know I have a notable Faculty that way. I read ye <i>two
Pages</i> at a <i>view</i>: the <i>Right-hand</i> Page with <i>one eye</i>, and the <i>Left</i>
with <i>t'other</i>, and then I carry <i>three Lines</i> before me at a time with
<i>each eye</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But can ye</i> Keep <i>what ye</i> Reade, <i>at this rate</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> I <i>remember</i> six times more then I <i>reade</i>; for I supply all that
was left out, and yet 'tis a wonderfull thing, I cannot for my heart's
blood remember <i>Faces</i>. I dare swear I have taken one man for another
twenty times; but I am altogether for <i>Things</i>, and <i>Notions</i>, d'ye see,
and such like; <i>Countenances</i>, let me tell ye, don't <i>AFFECT</i> me; And
yet I have a strange aversion for the two Faces I saw with you t'other
day.</p>

<p><i>Q. What D'ye mean</i>, Kings-man <i>and</i> Church-man?</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p><i>A. Devil's-man</i> and <i>Damms-man</i>: A couple of <i>Canary-Birds</i>, I'le
warrant 'em: But <i>Kings-man</i> is better yet then <i>Duke's-man</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why do ye talk thus of men of Quality, and Considerable Families?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Well! but I may live to see their Honours laid in the dust tho' for
all that. Prethee why is not <i>Circingle-man, Lawn-sleeve-man,
Mitre-man</i>, as good a name as <i>Church-man</i>? Pray what Family is this
same <i>Church-man</i> of, for I know a world of the <i>Name</i>? He's of the
<i>Prelatical House</i>, I suppose, Is he not?</p>

<p><i>Q. Well, and is he ever the worse for that?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Only <i>Antichrist</i> is the <i>Head</i> of the <i>Family</i>. Come let me talk a
little roundly to ye. How many sound <i>Protestant Divines</i> may there be
of that House now, d'ye think, in <i>England</i>, and <i>Wales</i>, and the Town
of <i>Berwick upon Tweed</i>? not above <i>Six</i>, if I be a <i>Christian</i>, and all
the rest are <i>Tantivy's</i>, and worshippers of the Beast: But I may live
yet to have the scowring of some of their Frocks for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Q. Prethee when didst thou see Mr.</i> Sancroft?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not a good while; but <i>Harry</i> and I had a Crash t'other day yonder
at <i>Greenwich</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. What's become of</i> L'Estrange <i>I wonder?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Who! <i>Towzer?</i> that <i>Impudent Dog</i>; That <i>Tory-Rascal</i>; That
<i>Fidling Curr</i>. He's in the Plot with <i>Celiers</i>, and young <i>Tong</i>, as
sure as thou'rt alive, and as Rank a <i>Papist</i> (let him swear what he
will) as ever Piss't.</p>

<p><i>Q. But has he not taken the</i> Sacrament <i>to the</i> contrary?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A <i>Popish Proselyte</i> is no more to be believ'd, upon his <i>Oath</i>,
than the <i>Devil himself</i> if he were to Expound upon the <i>Gospel</i>. Why
they have Dispensations to swear any thing.</p>

<p><i>Q. What and continue Papists still?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes: And go on still with the Hellish Popish Plot, as heartily as
ever they did before. Why don't you see how the Toad Brazens it out
still that he was not at <i>Somerset-House</i>? tho' <i>Prance</i> and <i>Mowbray</i>
swear they saw him there?</p>

<p><i>Q. Well, But who knows best? He</i> Himself, <i>or the</i> Witnesses?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not a fart matter; For whether 'twas so or not; It were better
Forty such Rogues were Hang'd then one Kings-Evidence Disparag'd.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p><i>Q. But did they not swear a little short, think ye?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nay, they might have sworn <i>homer</i>, I must confess.</p>

<p><i>Q. But now you mind me of</i> Somerset-House; <i>Do'nt you remember a
young Fellow of</i> Cambridge <i>that Refus'd to receive the Sacrament,
because (as he told his Master) he was reconcil'd to the Church, of</i>
Rome, <i>and Converted, and Baptiz'd at</i> Somerset-House? <i>This is an old
story ye must know. Why might not this be</i> Towzer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nay as like as not, for the <i>Universitys</i> are the very <i>Seminarys</i>
of <i>Popery</i>, and it will never be well with <i>England</i> till <i>those
Calves</i> be turn'd a <i>grazing</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But is there no believing of a</i> Converted Papist <i>upon his</i> Oath?
<i>Why does the Law receive 'em then (upon such and such Certain Tests)
for</i> statutable Protestants?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The <i>Law</i> never was among 'em as <i>I</i> have been. There's no such
thing (I tell ye) as a <i>Converted Papist</i>, and he shall sooner change
his <i>shape</i>, then his <i>Nature: Kiss a Book, Kiss mine Arse</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why d'ye talk thus at random?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Come, come, the <i>Outlandish Doctor</i> for my mony: that told one of
the <i>Macks</i> t'other day in the face of the <i>Bench</i>, that <i>he would let
down his Breeches and shite upon him. Plain-dealing's a Jewell.</i></p>

<p><i>Q. Thou'rt e'en as busy with a</i> Backside <i>as a</i> Glyster-Pipe. <i>But
(sluttery a part) Pray have a care what ye say; for if a</i> Proselyted
Papist <i>be not to be trusted upon his</i> Oath, <i>what becomes of the</i> Kings
Evidence <i>that</i> swear <i>under the</i> same Circumstances? <i>But here's enough
of this; and Pre'thee tell us now, how go squares in the</i> State <i>all
this while</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Oh very bad, very bad, nothing but <i>Tory-Rorys</i>, from top to
bottom. <i>Tory-Judges; Tory-Jurys; Tory-Justices; Tory-Officers;
Tory-Crackfarts; Tory-Pamphlets</i>. All, <i>Certiorari-men</i>, and <i>Yorkists</i>.
But I rattled up some of 'em there at the&mdash;&mdash;<i>What d'ye
call't-House</i>&mdash;&mdash;Oh they'r grown strangely Insolent since these Bawling
Addresses.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why what do they do?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why they set every <i>Rascally Squire</i> and <i>Doctor above</i> me: Nay,
they'l scarce put off their hats to me unless I begin; and then they
stand grinning at Me and my Train. Would you think now that a fellow<span class="pagenum">[Pg 19]</span>
should have the Impudence to call Me to an account, for nothing in the
world, but saying, that <i>he had</i> a Bitch <i>to his</i> Wife, <i>and</i> she <i>a</i>
Rogue <i>to her</i> Husband. And then to be call'd <i>Sirrah</i> for my pains,
only for telling a <i>Court-Kinsman</i> of his that <i>I should Lace the Rogue,
his Cozens Coat for him</i>. Well If I had not sent a Fool o'my errant I
had had the Rascal in <i>Lob's</i> Pound before this time.</p>

<p><i>Q. And how came ye to miss?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why the Agent that I employ'd was so set upon his Guts, that he
never minded the discourse at the Table. We had had him else. Or if he
could but have got him to ha' met me, we'd ha' done his business.</p>

<p><i>Q. But d'ye take this to be fair dealing now; to set any man at work
to betray his Host; or to give such language to people of Condition?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> What not when the <i>Protestant Religion</i> lies at <i>stake</i>? Why
Pre'thee I tell the Proudest of 'em all to their Teeth, that they are
<i>Villains</i> and <i>Scoundrells</i>. What do I care for their <i>Graces</i> and
<i>Reverences</i>, they <i>Pimp</i> for <i>Preferment</i>, and some of 'em shall hear
on't too <i>next Parliament</i>. But Hark ye I have a great deal of work upon
my hands, and I want an <i>Ammanuensis</i> out of all Cry.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why ye had a Pretty Fellow to'ther day, what's become of him?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> I'l tell ye then. A <i>Taylor</i> had made him a <i>Garment</i>: and
afterwards coming to him for the <i>mony</i>, he deny'd the Receit on't and
being prest upon it, he offer'd to purge himself upon <i>Oath</i>, that he
never had any such Garment. Upon this, the matter rested for a while;
but at length, it was prov'd where he had <i>Sold</i> it, and so the Taylor
had satisfaction. In short, I turn'd him away apon't, for he is no
servant for me that's <i>taken</i> in a false Oath.</p>

<p><i>Q. How is it possible for you to go thorough with all your
Writing-work?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Nay that's true; considering what a deal of other business I have;
for really there would be no Justice done, if I did not look after
<i>Witnesses</i>, <i>Jurys</i>, Choice of <i>City-Officers</i>, Election of <i>Members</i>
to serve in <i>Parliament</i>, both for <i>Town</i>, and <i>Country</i>; the disposing
of <i>Ecclesiastical Dignitys</i>; the <i>Jurisdiction</i> of <i>Courts</i>; the
<i>Government</i> of <i>Prisons</i>; the <i>Regulation</i> of <i>Messengers Fees</i>: In<span class="pagenum">[Pg 20]</span>
one word, the stress of the whole Government lyes in a manner upon my
shoulders; And I am so <i>Harrass'd</i> with it, that I profess I was e'en
thinking, a little before the Meeting of the last Parliament, to lay out
a matter of <i>Twenty or Thirty Thousand Pound</i> upon some Pretty Seat in
the Country, and Retire.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why truly for a man that has seen the world as you have done, what
can he do better?</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, I have seen the world to my Cost. 'Twas a sad thing for me,
you must think, that never went to bed in my Mothers House without four
or five Servants to wait upon me, (and if I had a mind to a <i>Tart</i>, a
<i>Custard</i>, or a <i>Cheescake</i> at any time, I had 'em all at command:) to
be <i>Hackny'd</i>, and <i>Jolted</i> up and down in a Forreign Country like a
<i>Common Body</i>.</p>

<p><i>Q. But what was it that put you upon</i> Travel?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The Desire I had to see <i>Religions</i>, and <i>Fashions</i>: And now it
comes in my head. Did you ever see my <i>Grounds and Occasions of the
Contempt of the Clergy</i>?</p>

<p><i>Q. Was That Yours then?</i></p>

<p><i>A. Mum</i>; betwixt friends. But I shall have a touch ere long at the
<i>Creed-making Rascal</i> there.</p>

<p><i>Q. Who's that?</i> Athanasius?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The very same. What a <i>Declaration</i> is there?</p>

<p><i>Q. But how d'ye like the Kings Declaration?</i></p>

<p><i>A. Not at all. Not at all.</i> It runs so much upon the <i>Arbitrary</i>, and
the <i>Prelatick</i>? Yes, and upon something else too.</p>

<p><i>Q. Come, 'Faith we should not part with dry lips, What d'ye think of
one</i> Roomer <i>now to the Health of? (Hark, and I'le tell ye.)</i></p>

<p><i>A.</i> I'le drink no <i>Traitors</i> Health.</p>

<p><i>Q. Why prethee what is</i> Civilly-Drinking <i>his Health, more then</i>
Dutifully Praying <i>for't</i>?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No: I am of the mans mind that said, I <i>hope the Devil will have
him; and if there be any punishment in Hell greater then another</i>, I
<i>hope the Devil will tear his soul to pieces</i>. So Farewell.</p>

<p><i>Q. What a Blessed sort of</i> Subjects <i>and</i> Christians <i>are these, that
value themselves in the</i> One Capacity, <i>for their</i> Contempt <i>of</i>
Authority: <i>And in the</i> other, <i>for the Zeal of Flying out into</i>
Blasphemys, <i>and</i> Execrations, <i>instead of</i> Prayers? <i>But what shall</i> I
<i>call this at last? A</i> Romantique, <i>or an</i> Historical Observator?</p>

<h2>THE<br>OBSERVATOR.</h2>

<h3>In <i>DIALOGUE</i>.</h3>
<hr style="width: 95%;">
<p class='center'><b>SATURDAY</b>, March 11. 1681.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">

<p><i>WHIG.</i> Come; I'le shew ye my <i>study, Tory</i>.</p>

<p><i>TORY.</i> Why you have got a Brave <i>Library</i> here.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> For a <i>Choice Collection</i>, let me tell ye, as any is in
<i>Christendom</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> You have all the <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin Fathers</i>, I suppose; the
<i>Councells</i>, the <i>Schoolmen</i>, and those People.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> I had'em all; but there's a great deal of <i>Trash</i>; and so I e'en
rid my hands of'em; though some of'em did pretty well too; considering
those <i>Dark Times</i>. Now here can I sit as <i>Snug</i> as a <i>Hare</i> in her
<i>Form</i>, and Chat away a Winters Evening with a <i>Good Fire</i>, a <i>Pipe</i>,
and a <i>Friend</i>, and never feel how the time spends.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Well! And why should not You and I keep our <i>Conferences</i> here
too?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Best of all: There's no body within hearing; and then we have our
<i>Books</i> and <i>Papers</i> about us, and all in such Order, that I'le lay my
Finger, Blindfold, upon any book you'le call for.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> But what Subject are they mostly of?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Matters of <i>State, History, Travells</i>, The Rights and Power of the
<i>People, Reformation, Religion, Discipline, Admonitions, Remonstrances,
Petitions, Appeals</i>; as ye see'em mark'd upon the Shelves. But all this
is nothing, you'l say, when y'ave seen my <i>Gallery</i>. Open that same Door
before ye.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Bless me! What a Treasure's here?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Look ye now. That side is all <i>News-Books,</i> and <i>Political
Divinity</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> You mean <i>Polemical</i> Divinity I suppose.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Ay Ay; 'Tis all one for that. Now all to'ther side is <i>Dissenting
Protestants</i>; as <i>Cartwright, Brown, Barrow, Robinson</i>, <i>Hetherington,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 22]</span>
Trask, Naylor, Best, Biddle, Muggleton</i>. And here are your <i>Muncerians,
Apostoliques, Separatists, Catharists, Enthusiasts, Adamits, Huttites,
Augustinians, Libertines, Georgites, Familists, Ranters Seekers,
Sweet-Singers, Antinomians, Arrians, Socinians, Millenaryes, Quakers</i>:
And in Two words; all the <i>Godly Party</i>. They make Fourteen Folio's of
Catalogue.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> But ha'ye no <i>Manuscripts</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Yes I have Three cases there beyond the Chimny, that I wou'd not
change for <i>Bodlies Library</i> three times over.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> What do they treat of?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Two of 'em are altogether upon the <i>Art of Government</i>, and the
<i>Third</i> is Cramm'd with <i>Lampoon</i> and <i>Satyr</i>. You sha'not name me any
one Copy that has scap'd me; nor any Exigent of State; but I'le furnish
ye out of these Papers with an Expedient for't.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> And wherein does this <i>Art of Government</i> Consist?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> In <i>Foresight, Experience, Presence of Thought, Prudence of
Direction</i>, and <i>Vigour of Execution</i>. To be short; Every Motion of the
<i>Head</i>, the <i>Eye</i>, the <i>Hand</i>, the <i>Foot</i>, the <i>Body</i>. Contributes a
part to this Great Work.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Is it a Science that may be Convey'd by <i>Instruction</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> With as much Ease as <i>Fencing</i>, or <i>Dancing</i>. There are Three or
Four <i>Dissenting Academies</i> here about the Town, where People are taught
to <i>Nod, Wink, Gape, Cough, Spit</i>; Nay the very <i>Tuning</i> of their
<i>Hum's</i> and <i>Haw's</i>, by <i>Rule and Method</i>; when to <i>Smite the Breast</i>,
and when to <i>Dust the Cushion</i>; when to <i>Leap</i> in the <i>Pulpit</i>, and when
to <i>Swim</i>; when to be <i>Serene</i>, and when to <i>Thunder</i>: Nay the <i>Faces</i>
they are to make at every <i>Period</i>; and the very <i>Measure</i> of their
<i>pauses</i>; that the <i>Parenthesis</i> may be large enough for the <i>Groans</i>, &amp;
<i>Ejaculations</i> of the <i>Secret ones</i> to <i>Play</i> in; they are taught to
Pray for the <i>King</i> with <i>One Tone</i> and <i>Countenance</i>, and for the
<i>Parliament</i> with <i>another</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> I have Observ'd them indeed to Cry with a Loud Voice, <i>Lord!
strengthen the Hands of the One</i>, &amp; then to drop the Note into a kinde
of a Piping whisper, with a <i>Lord! Turn the Heart of the Other</i>; which
is as much as to say, <i>Alas! the Poor Gentleman is out of his way, and
we must set all hands at work to bring him to comply with his</i>
Parliament, <i>though that</i> Handy work, <i>at last, bring his</i> Royall Head
<i>to the</i> Scaffold.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> If you wou'd not be a <i>Rogue</i> now and tell tales, I could let ye
in to the whole <i>Popular Mystery</i>; and shew ye the <i>Folly</i>, and the
<i>Vanity</i> of any other Claim to <i>Sovereign Power</i>. And then <i>I</i> have all
the <i>Prints</i> brought me as soon as ever they come out.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Pre'thee let's fall to work then.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Come, I'le give you a sight of one of my <i>Boxes</i> first; but I must
be gone in a quarter of an hour upon absolute Necessity.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Well! And whether in such hast?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> There's One at <i>Newington</i> has promis'd me an <i>Answer</i> to the
<i>Dissenters Sayings</i>; and then I am told of a <i>Godly Divine</i> at
<i>Clapham</i>, that has a <i>Reply</i> ready to the <i>Notes upon College</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Let's make the best of our time then. Stay a little; what have we
here?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Every thing is <i>Titled</i>, ye see, ready to your hand; so that you
may Pick and Chuse.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Let me see then. <i>Pious Frauds; Mentall Reservations;
Infallibility of the Assembly; Baxters Saints; Cases of Conscience;
Dispensations, Contributions, Maxims, Intelligence, Orders, Committees,
Juryes, Caballs, Religion, Property, Demands, Proposals, Grievances,
Pretences, Salvo's, Distinctions, Explanations, Projects, Directions,
Advices, Resolutions, Invectives, Fictions, Forms of Reproaches</i>, suited
to <i>All Persons, Orders</i>, and <i>Qualities; True-Protestant Privileges</i>;
The <i>Doctrine</i> of <i>Probabilityes</i>, and <i>Implicit Obedience</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Now upon all these Heads, ye have <i>Authoritys, Precedents</i>; and
all the <i>Colours, Arguments</i>, and <i>Elucidations</i> that the matter will
bear.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> But your <i>Pious Frauds, Mentall Reservations, Infallibility,
Dispensations, Salvo's, Distinctions, Probabilityes, Implicit Faith</i>;
These are all <i>Popish Points</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> They are so, when they are apply'd to the service of the Church of
<i>Rome</i>: but the <i>True Protestant-Cause Sanctifies</i> the <i>Principle</i>. As
there's a great difference betwixt the <i>Popes Excommunicating</i> of an
<i>Hereticall Prince</i>; and the <i>Generall Assemblys Excommunicating</i> of an
<i>Antichristian, Episcopall Prince</i>; betwixt a <i>Popish
Gunpowder-Treason</i>, in the <i>Cellers, under</i> the <i>Parliament-House</i>; and
a <i>Gunpowder Commission</i> to <i>Kill</i> and <i>Slay</i> within the <i>walls</i> of the
<i>Same House, above ground</i>; though to Carnal Eyes they may both appear<span class="pagenum">[Pg 24]</span>
to <i>Center</i> in the same <i>Point</i>: And so in like manner, betwixt a
<i>Conspiracy</i> of <i>Papists</i> to <i>cut off the King</i>, and <i>Subvert the
Government</i>; and a <i>True-Protestant-Association</i>, to the very <i>same
Effect</i>: Nay with this Advantage too; that the Latter Propounds the
Accomplishing of that, in a matter of a <i>month</i> or <i>six weeks</i>, which
the Zeal of their Fore-fathers was at least <i>Ten</i>, or a <i>dozen years a
doing</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> 'Tis a Great Ease for a man to have all these Subjects
<i>Common-Plac'd</i> to his hand.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Right. And where you may turn to any thing you have a mind to see,
with a <i>wet Finger</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> But Pray'e How do you approve (in many of our <i>Seisures</i>) of the
<i>Application</i> of <i>Popish Trinkets</i> to <i>Prophane Uses</i>, which were by
them Dedicated to the service of a <i>Superstitious Religion</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> You cannot Imagine, though an <i>Embroder'd Cope</i> may be an
<i>Abomination</i>, what a <i>Cordial the Pearl</i> of it is to a <i>True-Protestant
Professor. Lambs-Wool</i> drinks no way better then out of a <i>Chalice</i>. Or
in other Cases; 'Tis but Destroying the <i>Popish Form</i> of an <i>Idolatrous
Vessell</i>, and the <i>Intrinsick Value</i> is never the less <i>Current</i>
according to the <i>Standard</i> of the <i>Reformation</i>. The <i>Picture</i> of the
<i>Blessed Virgin</i>, with our <i>Saviour</i> in her Arms, is never a jot the
worse for <i>sale</i> to a <i>Painter</i>, for being an object of <i>Idolatry</i> about
the <i>Altar</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> And yet I have seen it Committed to the <i>Flames</i>, but it has been
an Oversight, betwixt the <i>Zeal</i> and the <i>Ignorance</i> of the
<i>Magistrate</i>. How many <i>Curious Crucifixes</i>, and <i>Reliques</i>, with
<i>Delicate Inlayings</i>, and <i>Carvings</i> have I seen Expos'd at <i>Gill</i> the
<i>Constables</i> in <i>Westminster</i>; truly, at very <i>Reasonable Rates</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Not unlikely; but then ye must know, they were <i>Seiz'd</i> in <i>One
Capacity</i>, and <i>sold</i> in <i>Another</i>; for they were <i>vended</i> in the
Contemplation of the <i>Workmanship</i>, though they were <i>taken</i> as the
<i>Fooleries</i> of a <i>False Religion</i>. We have in our days seen the
<i>Representation</i> of the <i>Trinity</i>, Demolish'd in a <i>Church-Window</i>, with
Extraordinary <i>Zeal</i> and <i>Approbation</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> Why truly I am as much against the making of any <i>Image</i> or
<i>Figure</i> of <i>God the Father</i> under the <i>Form</i> of a <i>Man</i>, as any body;
for <i>Twenty Mistakes</i> and <i>Inconveniencies</i> that may arise upon the
Consideration of such an <i>Object</i>; but I know no hurt in the world in<span class="pagenum">[Pg 25]</span>
the Representing of our <i>Saviour</i> under a <i>Human shape</i>; or of the <i>Holy
Ghost</i> under the shadow of a <i>Dove</i>: beside that the thing is presum'd
to have been done by <i>Authority</i>; for otherwise, the same <i>Zeal</i> that
Destroys but the <i>Window</i> of the <i>Church</i>, would not stick at the
Destroying perhaps of every thing else that belongs to't. But prethee
tell me One thing, suppose the <i>Blessed Trinity</i>, so Represented, should
be the <i>Seal</i> of an <i>Ancient</i> Community, or <i>Society</i> of men, what's the
difference betwixt that <i>Figure</i>, in <i>Graving</i>, or in <i>Nealing</i>; in
<i>Silver</i>, or in <i>Glass</i>? Would not you as much <i>scruple</i> the putting of
that <i>Seal</i> to a <i>Lease</i>, as the <i>seeing</i> of that <i>Figure</i> in a
<i>Church-Window</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> No; by no means; for the <i>One</i> is Purely a <i>Civil Act</i>; and the
<i>Other</i> has a Regard to <i>Religious Worship</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> And yet this <i>Image</i>, or <i>Pretended Resemblance</i>, is the <i>same
thing</i> in the <i>One</i>, as it is in the <i>Other</i>. Well! I am Extremly
pleas'd with this Private Corner for Liberty of Discourse.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Here you may have all the <i>Papers</i> as they come out, <i>Fresh and
Fresh</i>: All the <i>Arguments</i>, and <i>Politiques</i> of the <i>Dissenting Party</i>;
Chuse <i>your own Theme</i>, Take <i>your own Time</i>, and Treat upon <i>your own
Conditions</i>.</p>

<p><i>To.</i> That's as fair as any Mortall can wish; So that when the day does
not afford other matter to work upon, we may Look a little more narrowly
into the <i>Merits</i> of the <i>Cause</i>. And so much for that. But here let me
ask ye a Question: Do you know a <i>Little Cause-Jobber</i> yonder somewhere
about <i>Kings-street, in Covent Garden</i>?</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Does he not use the <i>Christian Coffee-House</i>?</p>

<p><i>To.</i> The very same. He was saying t'other day that <i>L'Estrange</i> was a
<i>Pensioner of Cromwels</i>; a <i>Papist</i>; and that he durst not bring his
<i>Action</i> against any man for <i>Calling</i> him so: That he was a <i>Rogue</i>; a
<i>Fidler</i>; Liv'd in <i>Covent-Garden</i> a good while, and got his <i>Living</i> by
his <i>Trade</i>; And that a <i>Magistrate</i>, not far from that place, would
<i>Justify</i> it. The Two first Points, I suppose, will be Disputed in
another place: And for the <i>Fidler</i>: 'Tis well known that <i>L'Estrange</i>
liv'd Eight or Nine years in one of the <i>Piazza-Houses</i> there; and kept
<i>Servants</i> that would have Scorn'd to have Sorted themselves with any
thing so mean as this <i>Paltry Varlet</i>. But to the Business. How far will
the <i>Privilege</i> of a <i>True-Protestant-Whig</i> Justify a <i>Villain</i> in so
many <i>Scandalous Lyes</i>?</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> So far as the <i>Common Good</i> of the <i>Cause</i> is more Valuable then
the <i>single Credit</i> of a <i>Private Person</i>. But what say ye now to
<i>Curtis's Advertisement</i> (in his Last <i>Mercury</i>) of <i>Tong's Narrative</i>,
and <i>Case</i>; concerning <i>L'Estrange</i>, Printed for C W?</p>

<p><i>To.</i> I say, 'tis <i>first</i>, a <i>Cheat</i>; for 'tis none of <i>Tong's Writing</i>;
<i>2ly</i>, 'Tis <i>Another Cheat</i>; for 'twas Printed for <i>Langley Curtis</i>,
with his Name to <i>Tongs Appointment</i> for the Printing of it: Only he has
Fobb'd a <i>New</i>, and a <i>False Title-Page</i> to't. But what says Mr.
<i>Oates</i>, all this while, to <i>L'Estranges Enformation</i> against <i>Tonge</i>,
in the <i>Shammer Shamm'd</i>? where that young Fellow has the Impudence to
declare under his hand, the very <i>Foundation</i> of <i>Oates's</i> Plot to be a
<i>Cheat</i>: And <i>I appeal to all Good Protestants for Justice upon that
Scandalous Wretch</i>.</p>

<p><i>Wh.</i> Nay, 'tis a horrible Abuse, and really the man stands in's own
light: What was't? 500 or a 1000 Pound that he recover'd of One that did
not say the Hundredth part of what this comes to? The Lord Deliver me! I
knew the Time when 'twas <i>half a Hanging-matter</i> to have made the least
doubt of any Branch of the Hellish Plot: But for this Audacious Fool to
say in Expresse Terms, that [<i>the</i> Four Jesuites Letters, <i>wherein</i>
Oates <i>pretended was the whole Discovery, were</i> Counterfeits] is utterly
Intolerable. I'le e'en go my ways immediately, and talk with the Doctor
about it.</p>

<h2>THE<br>OBSERVATOR,</h2>

<p><i>A</i> Schism <i>a Greater Judgment then a</i> Pestilence. <i>The</i> Natural
Rhetorique <i>of the</i> Non-Cons. <i>The</i> Danger <i>of them. Several</i> Sorts
<i>and</i> Degrees <i>of Danger. Of Coming</i> About, <i>or Coming</i> Over. <i>The</i>

<hr style="width: 95%;">
<p class='center'><b>Munday</b>, September 28. 1685.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">

<p><i>OBSERVATOR.</i> If I were the <i>Master</i> of a <i>Territory</i>, I would as soon
<i>Trust</i> so many <i>Spirits</i> in my <i>Pulpits, to Blow a Pestilence thorough
my Dominions</i>, as so many of our <i>Non-Conforming Divines</i>; and reckon my
<i>People</i> much <i>Safer</i> too, under the Danger of a <i>Plague</i>, then under
the <i>Consequences</i> of a <i>Schism</i>: For the <i>One Taints</i> but the Bodies of
Men; the <i>Other Destroys</i> their very Souls; the <i>One</i> takes them
<i>Promiscuously</i>, the <i>Good</i>, and the <i>Bad, One</i> with <i>Another</i>: But the
<i>'Tother Marks</i>, and <i>Singles-out</i> the <i>Best Men</i> for <i>Ruine</i>, with a
<i>Privilege</i> of <i>Exemption</i>, to those that neither fear <i>God</i>, nor <i>Man</i>.
The <i>One</i> Sweeps away a Number of Single <i>Persons</i>; the <i>Other</i> Tears to
pieces the <i>Sinews</i> of a <i>Community</i>. The <i>One</i> does, in <i>some Degree</i>,
Conduce to the <i>Purging</i> of a <i>Wicked Nation</i>, when the <i>Wrath</i> of
<i>Heaven</i> is <i>Appeas'd</i> by the <i>Discharge</i> of some <i>Dreadfull Judgment</i>
upon't; (as the <i>Air</i> is Clear'd by <i>Thunder</i>) The <i>Other</i> does All that
is <i>Possible</i> to the <i>Filling-up</i> of the <i>Measure</i> of a <i>Publique
Iniquity</i>; and the making of a Land Ripe for <i>Vengeance</i>.</p>

<p><i>TRIMMER.</i> Prethee what <i>Danger</i>? Or what needs this <i>Lashing</i>, when
they are All Tongue-Ty'd; and Driven into <i>Holes</i>, and <i>Hiding-Places</i>,
to keep out of the way of <i>Messengers</i>, and <i>Constables</i>, and out of the
<i>Clutches</i> of the <i>Corporation-Act</i>, and <i>Other Penal Laws</i> against
their <i>Private Meetings</i>?</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> What dost thou Talk of Tongue-Ty'd? Why I will undertake it; (and
in <i>Serious Good Earnest</i> too) <i>Gagg</i> the Whole Set of'em; Give Every
man his <i>Pulpit</i>, or his <i>Chair</i>, and only a Bare Standing in't; and if<span class="pagenum">[Pg 28]</span>
they do not <i>Wink</i>, and <i>Nod</i>, and <i>Cuff</i> any Prince in <i>Christendom</i>
out of his <i>Dominions</i>, without a <i>Word Speaking</i>, I'le be thy
<i>Bond-slave</i>. Why they do not do their Bus'ness, man, by the Force of
<i>Logique, Grammar</i>, or by the <i>Dint</i> of <i>Theology</i>: But by <i>Groans,
Pangs, Tragical Ululations, Silent Interjections, Whining Apostrophes,
Melting Epiphonemas</i>; and in a word; by the Helps of <i>Natural
Rhetorick</i>, without <i>Need</i>, of either <i>Sense</i>, or <i>Syllables</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> They <i>Preach</i>, and <i>Pray</i>, without <i>Speaking</i> then.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> No No. They do Talk for <i>Fashion</i>-sake: But Observe it while you
will; They move the <i>Passions</i> of their <i>Auditory</i>, in the <i>Belfry</i>, or
the <i>Church-Porch, Forty times more</i> then Directly under the <i>Pulpit</i>:
For the <i>Emphasis</i> of an <i>Action</i>; a <i>Motion, Tone</i>, or <i>Countenance</i>,
makes a much Deeper <i>Impression</i>, than that of a <i>Naked, Empty, Sound</i>:
And for <i>My Part</i>, I fancy, it might do as well for 'em to Whistle their
<i>Preachments</i> as to Articulate them: For the <i>Masterpiece</i>, or the All
in All of it, lies Mainly, in <i>Hitting</i> the <i>Tune</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> D'ye call this Reasoning, or Ridiculing?</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 'Tis <i>Both</i> in <i>One</i>: For it is the <i>Ridiculous Truth</i>, and the
<i>Just Reason, Method</i>, and <i>State</i> of the <i>Matter</i>: And when People are
once <i>Juggled</i> Out <i>of their Wits</i>, they must be <i>Fool'd</i> Into <i>'em
again</i>. Now there needs no more to the doing of <i>That Work</i>, then the
bare <i>Drawing</i> of the <i>Curtain</i>, and letting People into the
<i>Tyring-Room</i>. For the <i>Cause</i>, is all over, <i>Theatrical</i>: The <i>Actors</i>
are <i>Hypocrites</i>, in their <i>Manners</i>, as well as in the <i>Etymon</i>; and
the whole <i>Manage</i>, fitter for a <i>Stage</i>, then a <i>Pulpit</i>. So that the
most <i>Certain Way</i> in <i>Nature</i>, for the making of the <i>Practice,
Odious</i>; and the <i>Disabusing</i> of the <i>Undiscerning Multitude</i>, is to
<i>lay Open</i> their <i>False Colours, Shapes</i>, &amp; <i>Disguises</i>; and <i>Expose</i>
Every thing in its <i>Naked Simplicity</i> to the <i>Light</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> And what if a man should Allow This sort of People now, to be
the most <i>Uncouth, Hideous Monsters</i> of the <i>Creation</i>? To have the
<i>Teeth</i>, the <i>Nails</i>, the <i>Fierceness</i>, the <i>Strength</i>, &amp; the <i>Appetite</i>
of the most <i>Ravenous</i> of <i>Wild Beasts</i>? This Discourse, of <i>Caution</i>,
and <i>Description</i>, might do well enough in the <i>Countrys</i> of <i>Lyons</i>,
and <i>Tygers</i>: But what's All This, to <i>his Majesties Dominions</i>, where
there are either <i>None</i> of These Creatures, <i>at all</i>, or No <i>Other</i>, at
least, then such as have their <i>Nails Par'd</i>, and their <i>Chops<span class="pagenum">[Pg 29]</span>
Muzzled</i>: And no more <i>Danger</i> of them, at present, then of our
<i>Beeves</i>, and <i>Muttons</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> Dost not thou know that there are <i>Several</i> Sorts, &amp; Degrees of
<i>Danger</i>? A man may be Wheedled into a <i>Precipice</i>, as well as Thrown
into't: A man may be Hugg'd or Suck'd to <i>Death</i>, without any Biting, or
Scratching in the Case: A man may be Poyson'd in his <i>Porridge</i>, as well
as Strangl'd in his <i>Bed</i>: A man may have False Opinions <i>Impos'd</i> upon
him by a <i>Fallacy</i>, or <i>Fraud</i> in <i>Argument</i>, as well as Extorted from
him, by the Force of <i>Menace</i>, and <i>Torment</i>. And his Bus'ness, at last,
is <i>done</i>, as Dead, <i>One way</i> as <i>T'other</i>: And so for the Degrees of
<i>Danger</i>; There's <i>Danger at Hand</i>; there's <i>Danger</i> at a <i>Distance</i>;
<i>Danger</i> in <i>Design</i>, and <i>Danger</i> in <i>Practice</i>; And <i>Danger</i>, in fine,
through All the <i>Preparatory</i>, and <i>Mediate Tendencies</i> to <i>Mischief</i>,
to the <i>Last Effect</i> that <i>Pushes</i> it self forth to <i>Execution</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Very Good! And what are All These <i>Sorts</i>, and <i>Degrees</i> of
<i>Danger</i> to the <i>Instances</i> we have now <i>Before</i> us?</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 'Tis true; The <i>Faction</i> is not in Condition to <i>Attacque</i> the
<i>Government</i> by <i>Force</i>: Their <i>Armies</i> are <i>Scatter'd</i>, and their
<i>Squadrons Defeated</i>; the <i>Whole Party</i> put to their <i>Shifts</i>; and the
very <i>Best</i> of 'em, has enough to do to <i>save his Own Bacon</i>. Their
<i>Teeth</i> are <i>Drawn</i>, I'le Allow ye, All but here and there a <i>Stump</i>;
And yet they'l <i>Pinch, Plaguily</i>, though they cannot <i>Worry</i>, and
<i>Tear</i>: And with <i>Time</i>, and <i>Good Discipline</i>, they'l come to <i>Grow
again</i>. They have the <i>Same Principles</i> to friend, that <i>ever</i> they had:
Only they must be <i>Manag'd Another Way</i>: And there can never Want
<i>Matter</i>, for <i>Artificial Flattery, Wheedling, Imposture</i> and
<i>Hypocrisy</i>, to <i>Work</i> upon. They are not in Condition to <i>Advance</i>, at
this time of the Day, in the face of the <i>Sun</i>, and of the <i>Government</i>,
with their <i>Petticoats Flying</i>, under the <i>Auspicious Direction</i> of
their <i>Tutelary Angel, Ferguson</i>; and [Fear Nothing but God] for their
<i>Motto</i>. But they must Supply want of <i>Strength</i>, by <i>Stratagem</i>; and
<i>Carry-on</i> their <i>Approches</i>, out of sight. 'Tis only a little more
<i>Patience</i>, and the <i>Work</i> will be brought about, as sure at the
<i>Long-Run</i>, by a <i>Mine</i>, as by a <i>Battery</i>: And the <i>Certifying</i> of <i>a
Hundred and Fifty Perrots</i> into the <i>Service</i>, and <i>Protection</i> Of the
<i>Government</i>, will be of Greater <i>Effect</i>, then the <i>Drawing-up</i> of <i>Ten
Thousand men in Arms</i>, Against it. Now <i>These Methods</i> lye All <i>Open</i><span class="pagenum">[Pg 30]</span>
still, only they are somewhat more <i>About</i>. Now as to <i>Dangers Remote</i>,
or <i>Nearer hand; Dangers</i> of <i>Design</i>, or <i>Dangers</i> of <i>Practice</i>: All
the <i>Preparatories</i>, &amp; <i>Dispositions</i> to <i>Mischief</i>, in their <i>Secret
Impulses</i>, and <i>Causes</i>, are as <i>Vigorous</i> Now, as Ever they were, that
is to say, within Two or Three Motions of a <i>Publique Violence</i>: Only
This Difference in the Case, that we have <i>Hitherto</i>, been in the
<i>Greatest Danger</i> of our <i>Profess'd</i>, &amp; <i>Open Enemies</i>: And <i>Now</i>, God
bless us from our <i>Pretending Friends</i>: For all on a Sudden, the
<i>Trimmers</i> are come-up to be <i>Stark Church-of-England-men</i>; And the
<i>Phanatiques</i>, gotten a <i>Form Higher</i>, into the <i>Seat</i> or <i>Classes</i> of
the <i>Trimmers</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Thou art <i>Well, neither Full nor Fasting</i>. Neither <i>Fanatique</i>,
nor <i>Trimmer</i>, nor <i>Church-of-England-man</i> I perceive, will please ye;
The <i>Controversy</i> of a New King; or a Common-Wealth, is <i>Out of Doors</i>;
The Question of Liberty of Conscience; The <i>Privilege</i> of <i>Private
Meetings</i> for Religous Worship; And a <i>Challenge</i> of <i>Dispensation</i> from
the <i>Rites, Ceremonies, and</i> Discipline <i>of the Church, are</i> All layd
aside. And All This will not serve the <i>Turn</i> yet. Now if Men go to
<i>Church</i>; Take <i>Tests</i>, make <i>Declarations</i>; And <i>Do</i> and <i>Perform</i> All
that the <i>Law Requires</i> of'em; where's the <i>Danger</i> of These People I
beseech ye?</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> Not in their <i>coming over</i> with their <i>Bodies</i>, but in <i>Staying
behind</i>, in their <i>Good Wills</i>, and <i>Affections</i>: Nay, and in their
<i>Communicating</i> with the <i>Church</i> in the <i>Morning</i>, and in the
<i>Afternoon</i>, with the <i>Schism</i>: And pray will you Note in them, One
Thing <i>More</i> too. 'Tis worth the while, when they <i>Ramble</i> from their
<i>Own Parish</i>, to <i>Observe</i> whither they go: For I have known the very
<i>Streets Throng'd</i>, out of Distance of <i>Hearing One Word</i> that the
<i>Minister says</i>, with the <i>Same Superstition</i>, that the <i>Quakers Flock</i>
to the <i>Door</i>, when they are <i>Lock'd-out</i> of the <i>Meeting-House</i>: In
which Case, It has yet the <i>Semblance</i> of a <i>Private Meeting</i>; And in
Truth, looks liker a <i>Political Muster</i>, then a <i>Religious Exercise</i>:
But Heark ye for One Word, before we go any further; Suppose a Man
should have sayd about the <i>Beginning</i> of <i>July Last</i>, in a <i>Brisk
Reply</i> to a <i>Reflexion</i> made upon the <i>Western-Rebells</i>; (at that time
in their <i>Pride</i> and <i>Glory</i>) [The King has as Loyal Subjects in That
Army as Any are in T'other.] Wouldst thou have me, in Construction of
<i>Common Sense</i>, and <i>Honesty</i>, look upon <i>That Person</i>, to be,
Effectually Come over, and in the <i>State</i> of <i>a True<span class="pagenum">[Pg 31]</span>
Church-of-England-man</i>; only for <i>Keeping</i> the <i>Law</i>, with his <i>Heels</i>,
when he <i>Breaks</i> it, with his <i>Tongue</i>, and <i>Doctrine</i>? Now this is more
then I Owe ye, upon the Matter in hand: For you have Carry'd the
<i>Question</i> quite <i>back</i> again, from the <i>Non-Con-Ministers</i>, to the
<i>Generality</i>, and the <i>Multitude</i> of the <i>Dissenters</i>: which is a Point
Wholly <i>Excepted</i>, and out of the <i>Limits</i> of <i>Our Debate</i>: For All
their <i>Conventicles</i> without a <i>Mouth</i>, are <i>Monsters</i>; Meer
<i>Nullities</i>, &amp; <i>Bilks</i>, without a <i>Teacher</i>: So that I have <i>Restrain'd</i>
my <i>Applications</i>, Singly, to the <i>Rabbi's</i> of the <i>Faction</i>, as
<i>Including</i>, and <i>Implying</i> the <i>Sense</i>, and the <i>Intent</i> of their
<i>Disciples</i>: Nay and <i>so far Including</i> it, that they are <i>Barely</i>, the
<i>Passive Instruments</i> of their <i>Leaders</i>. Now These <i>Heads</i> of the
<i>Divided Parties</i>, are a sort of People, that do not, by any Means, fall
within the <i>Charitable Prospect</i> of <i>Your Qualifications</i>: For they
<i>Stand-off</i>, in <i>Contempt</i>, and <i>Defyance</i> of the <i>Orders</i>, &amp; <i>Censures</i>
of the <i>Church</i>, and of the <i>Law</i>, as much at <i>This Instant</i>, as <i>ever</i>
they did. Their <i>Followers Maintain</i>, and <i>Support</i> them in That
<i>Stubbornness</i> of <i>Disobedience</i>; And so the <i>Opposition</i> stands yet
<i>Firm</i>, in <i>Effect</i>, though with <i>Less Noise</i> of <i>Menace</i>, and <i>Tumult</i>.
The <i>Branches</i>, 'tis True, are <i>Lopt</i>; but the <i>Root</i>, not so much as
<i>Touch'd</i>; Nay, and in such a Condition of <i>Vegetative Virtue</i>, and
<i>Vigour</i>, that it wants nothing but <i>Time</i>, and a <i>Favourable Season</i> to
make it <i>Sprout</i> again. And This you may Assure your self of, that
Nothing less then an <i>Utter</i>, an <i>Open</i>, a <i>Solemn</i>, and an <i>Irrevocable
Divorce</i>, betwixt <i>These Libertine-Seducers</i>, and Those that have been
<i>Trepann'd</i>, and <i>Inveigled</i>, out of the <i>Bosom</i> of the <i>Church</i>, into
the <i>Arms</i> of the <i>Schism</i>: Nothing I say, less then Some such
<i>Unalterable Act</i>, or <i>Decree</i> of <i>Separation</i>, can ever <i>Secure</i>,
either the <i>Church</i>, or the <i>State</i> from the <i>Pernicious Consequences</i>
of this <i>Intelligence</i>: For betwixt <i>Blind Pity</i>, and <i>Foolish Zeal</i>, on
the <i>One</i> hand, and all the <i>Arts</i>, of <i>Moving</i>, and <i>Provoking</i> Those
<i>Passions</i>, and <i>Affections</i>, on the <i>Other</i>, there is <i>kept-up</i>, and
<i>Cherish'd</i>, a <i>Communication</i> of <i>Reciprocal Kindness</i>, between them,
that keeps the <i>Fire alive</i> still in the <i>Embers</i>, 'till by <i>Degrees</i>,
it <i>Blows-up</i> All at last into a <i>Common Flame</i>. Now take away <i>These
Bellows</i>, and <i>T'other Sparks</i>, and a man may <i>Sleep</i> in his <i>Bed</i>,
without <i>Dreaming</i> of <i>Conflagrations</i>, or the <i>Dread</i> of Rising with
his Throat Cut.</p><p><span class="pagenum">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> I will not Excuse some <i>Hot-Headed Blades</i>, that let their
<i>Tongues</i> run before their <i>Wits</i>; And make it a Point of <i>Honour</i>, to
<i>Brave</i> All the <i>Terrors</i> of <i>Death</i>, and <i>Dungeons</i>, in defence of the
<i>Cause</i> that they have <i>Undertaken</i>. The <i>Less said</i>, the <i>Better</i>;
Though a Body cannot, in <i>Generosity</i>, but have some sort of
<i>Compassion</i>, for a Man that Suffers <i>Death</i>, with <i>Constancy of Mind</i>,
Even in a Mistaken Cause, if it be according to his <i>Conscience</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> If these <i>Impressions</i> were <i>Inbred</i>, and the <i>Errors</i> purely
their <i>Own</i>, it would be a <i>Point</i>, not only of <i>Good Nature</i>, but of
<i>Common Justice</i>, and <i>Humanity</i>, to have a <i>Tenderness</i> for <i>People</i>
under an <i>Invincible Mistake</i>: But you have Started the <i>Strongest
Argument</i> in the World, against your <i>self</i> here, by <i>Enforcing</i> the
<i>Necessity</i> of Clearing the <i>Stage</i> of the <i>Seditious Oracles</i>, that
<i>Inspire These Desperate Resolutions</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Why All matter of <i>Violence, Heat</i> of <i>Dispute</i>, and <i>Clamour</i>
of <i>Argument</i>, is at an <i>End</i>. You hear no more of your <i>Scottish</i>, and
<i>Western Declarations</i>; No more <i>Competitors</i> for the <i>Crown</i>; or
<i>Confederates</i> for a <i>Republique</i>: And therefore prethee, <i>let</i> us be at
<i>Peace</i> while we <i>May</i> be at <i>Peace</i>; and do not stand <i>Puzzling</i> the
<i>People</i> with <i>Danger</i>, where <i>No Danger is</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> Soft and Fair, <i>Trimmer</i>; those <i>Declarations, Practices</i>, and
<i>Attempts</i>, are not to be <i>Repeated</i> again in the <i>same Age</i>: But there
are <i>more ways to the Wood then One</i>: And 'tis All a case, to a man
that's <i>Robb'd</i>, whether the <i>Thieves</i> came in at the <i>Door</i>, or at the
<i>Window</i>. 'Tis very Right, That, since the Breaking of the <i>Rebellion</i>,
the <i>Non-Cons</i> lay their <i>Fingers</i> upon their <i>Mouths</i>; and not <i>One
Word</i> of <i>Late</i>, upon the Subject of <i>Liberties</i>, and <i>Properties</i>; or
of the Danger of <i>Tyranny</i>, and of <i>Arbitrary Power</i>: But All other
<i>Grievances</i> are Now <i>Swallow'd-up</i> in <i>One</i>: They are All in <i>Tears</i>
for fear of the <i>Protestant Religion</i>; and <i>That's the Topique that's
now Carry'd-on, through All Shapes, Figures, and Disguises</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> We shall have fine Work, Next Bout!</p>

<p class="center">Same Common Principles. <i>The</i> Rise of Jelousies.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">
<p class='center'><b>Saturday</b>, August 21. 1686.</p>
<hr style="width: 95%;">

<p><i>TRIMMER.</i> The <i>Accommodating</i> of Words, Phrases, and Texts to the
Matter in hand, with the Interjecting, here and there, of Certain
<i>Emphatical Winks</i>, and <i>Innuendo's</i>, to the <i>Common People</i>, will do
the Bus'ness of <i>Fears and Jelousies</i>, you need never <i>Doubt</i> it,
without any more Ceremony.</p>

<p><i>OBSERVATOR.</i> I do no more <i>Doubt</i> it, then I do, that a Proper Remedy;
Rightly Prepar'd; and Administer'd in the <i>Due</i> Time and Proportion,
will <i>Work</i> such or such an <i>Effect</i>. But the <i>Skill</i> lyes, in the
Judgment of the Distemper; The Constitution of the Patient; The Choice
of the Physick; The Prescription of the Composition, the Preparation,
and the Dos. Now <i>Your</i> way of <i>Operating</i>, is only the Mechanicall
<i>Part of the Bus'ness</i>; and no more, then the giving of a <i>Box</i>, a
<i>Gally-pot</i>, or a <i>Glass</i>, with a Note of <i>Directions</i>, out of <i>One</i>
hand into <i>Another</i>: which Any <i>Porter</i> that Plyes at the <i>Next Corner</i>,
would do as <i>Dext'rously</i>, as ever a <i>Doctor</i> of the <i>College</i>. The
<i>Difficulty</i>, and the <i>Mystery</i>, is Over, before <i>You</i> have any thing to
<i>Do</i> with it: The <i>Poysonous</i>, and <i>Intoxicating Draught</i>, Prepar'd; The
<i>Multitude</i> set a-Gaping for't, and Your <i>Office</i>, is only at last, to
<i>Pour it down their Throats</i>. There's Matter of <i>History</i>, and <i>Fact</i>,
enough, 'tis true, to <i>Satisfy any man</i>, that People may be made as
<i>Mad</i> with <i>Cant</i>, and <i>Gibberish</i>, as if they had taken <i>Henbane</i>; and
that <i>the</i> Sting <i>of</i> Jelousy, will put them out of their <i>Wits</i> as soon
as <i>the</i> Biting <i>of a</i> Mad-Dog: But we are in the <i>Dark</i> all this while,
for the Rise, the Progress, and the Methods of Enflaming <i>Jelousies</i>, to
bring'em up to that <i>Pitch</i>. Prethee let me Understand a little of their
Birth, Growth, Discipline, and Education; How they are Fed, Nourish'd,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 34]</span>
and Entertain'd? What's the End, and Use of them? What Language do they
<i>Speak</i>; or how comes it to pass, that the <i>Same</i> Words, and Phrases,
without <i>Any Intelligence</i> with <i>Grammar, Logique, Common Usage</i>, or
<i>Propriety</i>, should <i>Transport</i> Some <i>Men</i> into <i>Outrages, Palpitations
of the Heart, Horrors</i>, and <i>Tremblings</i>, both of <i>Mind</i>, and of <i>Body</i>;
and yet Work no more upon Others, then they <i>did</i>, before the very
Letters of'em were taken out of the <i>Alphabet</i>? I do not call ye to a
<i>Strict Shrift</i> upon <i>Every Point</i>, but I Expect you shall say something
to the <i>Whole Matter</i>; for a <i>Few Words</i>, in Order, will give a man more
<i>Light</i> to the <i>Reason</i> of a Thing, then as many <i>Volumes</i>, in
Confusion.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> You are in the <i>Right</i>; that the <i>Craft</i> lies in the Project,
and the Preparatory <i>Manage</i> of this Affair, and that the <i>Danger</i> is
gone too <i>Far</i>, when the <i>Mine</i> is already <i>Wrought</i>; the <i>Powder
Dispos'd</i>, and nothing wanting to the <i>Final Execution</i> of the
<i>Mischief</i>, but the <i>Lighting</i> of the <i>Match</i>, and the Applying of the
<i>Coal</i> to the <i>Train</i>. You have <i>Well</i> and <i>Truly</i> enough <i>Observed</i>,
the <i>Wonderfull Force</i>, that <i>Some Certain</i> Words, and Phrases have;
upon the <i>Affections</i> of the <i>Multitude</i>; without the Least <i>Shadow</i> of
any Logical, Grammatical, or Philosophical <i>Reason</i> for the <i>Operation</i>
of them. Now you must know, that <i>These</i> Words, and Phrases, are made
<i>Use</i> of, and <i>Understood</i>, in the way of a Cypher, or a Jargon, and not
according to the <i>Ordinary Acceptation</i> of them, in a <i>Regular</i> way of
<i>Writing</i>, or of <i>Speaking</i>; So that, Effectually, the <i>Efficacy</i> of
such <i>Words</i>, and <i>Phrases</i>, is given for <i>Granted</i>; and how they come
to <i>Obtain that Force</i>, remains the <i>Single Question</i>.</p>

<p>Now towards the <i>Understanding</i> of this Matter, you must Consider, that
no <i>State</i> can be <i>Supplanted</i>, but by <i>Turning</i> the <i>Peoples Hearts</i>,
against the <i>Persons</i>, &amp; the <i>Actions</i> of their <i>Superiors</i>: So that in
<i>All Conspiracies</i> to <i>Destroy</i> a <i>Government</i>, Fears &amp; Jelousies, are
<i>the</i> Corner Stone <i>of the Babel</i>. Their Hearts are no sooner <i>Lost</i>,
but they withdraw their Bodies too, and so, by <i>Degrees, Erect</i> Laws,
and Religions of their Own; and look upon themselves, by This time, as
in <i>Another Commonwealth</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> 'Tis most <i>Certainly True</i>; and that in this <i>Separation</i>, they
set-up an <i>Interest</i> of <i>Direct</i> Spite, as well as Opposition, to That
of the <i>Church</i>, and of the <i>State</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> This is the very Course, and Progress of a <i>Popular Jelousy</i>:<span class="pagenum">[Pg 35]</span>
But pray take Notice as we go, that the <i>People</i>, are thus far, <i>Meerly</i>
Passive; and <i>Contribute No Otherwise</i>, to the <i>Ruine</i> of the
<i>Publique</i>, then <i>a</i> Snapping Sea does, to the <i>Sinking</i> of a <i>Vessell</i>,
when the <i>Billows</i> are <i>Hurry'd-on</i> by the <i>Violence</i> of an Irresistible
Tempest: if the <i>Winds</i> would but let the <i>Waves alone</i>, they'd be
<i>Quiet</i>. When they come once to Gather into [Private Meetings,] (or as
you call them, Conventicles) you may <i>Then</i> accompt upon it, that they
are as good as put to <i>School</i>, to <i>Learn</i> the Mystery of their
<i>Profession</i>. For there are Canting-Schools, as well as Reading-Schools:
and under This <i>Discipline</i>, they come by <i>Insensible Degrees</i>, to part
with their <i>English</i> Tongue, as well as with their <i>English</i> Principles,
and Manners. Nay, and Effectually, to take up such <i>Uncouth, Novel</i>, and
<i>Strange</i> Thoughts, Opinions, and Practices, that it looks, as if the
English-Man, the Christian, and the Subject, were all lost in a
Disguise. They are now, you must know, under New Lords, and
Consequently, under New Laws; where they are <i>Train'd-up</i> to <i>New Ways</i>
of Understanding Things, and to a <i>New Idiome</i> of Expressing them.
Religion, Law, Government, Conscience, Good Manners, are so <i>Sacred</i> in
Themselves, that the <i>Worst</i> of Men cannot but <i>Pretend</i> a <i>Veneration</i>
for them; but how to <i>Baffle</i>, or to <i>Elude</i> the <i>Force</i>, the
<i>Obligation</i>, and the <i>Authority</i> of them; and, at the Same Time, to
set-up for the <i>Asserters</i>, and <i>Supporters</i> of <i>These Publique Rights,
Privileges</i>, and <i>Duties, There</i> lies the <i>Difficulty</i> of the
<i>Undertaking</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> That is to say, how to <i>Resolve</i> Religion, into an <i>Empty</i>
Notion: To Talk Christianity into a Paradox; and, with Christ in our
<i>Mouths</i>, at <i>London</i>, to <i>fall down</i>, and <i>Worship</i> Mahomet, in <i>Buda</i>:
How to <i>Confound</i> Gods, and the Governments Friends and Enemies, so as
to make the <i>Common People</i> take <i>One</i> for <i>T'other</i>. Now This can be no
way done, but by setting-up the Counterfeit of Religion, Law, and
Conscience, against the <i>Genuine</i>, and <i>Authentique</i> Original; and by
making Evil, to be Good, and Good, to be Evil.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> You must <i>Note</i>, further, that in This <i>Opposition</i>, the Main
Cause appears to be the <i>very Same</i>, on <i>Both sides</i>; and <i>Both Parts</i>
seem to <i>Contend</i>, for the Same Common Principles, of <i>Divine Worship</i>,
and of <i>Civil Obedience</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> Only the <i>One</i> Flies to the <i>Invisible Lights</i> and <i>Dictates</i> of
the <i>Spirit</i>, in Matter of Religion; (taking Fancy for Revelation) and,<span class="pagenum">[Pg 36]</span>
in the Matter of Government, has Recourse to Certain <i>Unaccountable
Whimsies</i>, of [Powers Reserv'd,] where there <i>never was any Power at
all</i>; &amp; <i>These Fooleries</i>, they <i>Trump</i> upon the <i>Little People</i>, under
the <i>Pompous Name</i> of [<i>FUNDAMETALS</i>;] while the <i>Rulers</i>, on the
<i>Other</i> hand, Stick to the Law, to the Text, and to the <i>Approved Sense</i>
of the Best Interpreters of Both, for their <i>Guide</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Very Good! And after they have <i>Departed</i> from the Common Rule,
and <i>Divided</i> themselves from the Common Interest; it is but Reasonable
to <i>Expect</i>, that they will Set-up Another Interest, and Another Rule to
<i>Themselves</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> Well! But how do they <i>Manage That Province</i> all this while, as
to the <i>Subject</i>, I mean, that we were <i>Speaking</i> of?</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Why their way is, only to put <i>Religion</i>, and <i>Government</i> in
<i>Another Dress</i>; but under the Name, of [Religion,] and [<i>Government</i>,]
<i>Still</i>; and then to lay on a <i>Superstructure</i>, Answerable to the
<i>Foundation</i>; I speak of the Leaders only; for their Disciples are
<i>Blanck Paper</i>; and ready for <i>any Impression</i>. They <i>Talk</i>, to the
Ears, and to the Passions of their <i>Hearers</i>, not to their
Understandings: and their <i>Auditors</i> gather more of their <i>Meaning</i>,
from their <i>Gestures, Actions, Countenances</i>, and from <i>Pathetical
Tones</i>, then from the <i>Words Themselves</i>. As for <i>Sense</i>, or <i>No Sense</i>,
'tis <i>all a Case</i>; for 'tis the <i>Jingle</i>, not the <i>Matter</i>, that does
<i>Their Bus'ness</i>. The <i>Less</i> the People Understand, the <i>More</i> they are
Edify'd; for they take the <i>Congruities</i> of Carnal Reason, for Vain
Philosophy; and Incomprehensible Nonsense, passes for <i>the Work of the</i>
Light Within. Their <i>Religion</i> lies alltogether in Groan, and Rapture:
<i>They Sacrifice to the</i> Unknown God; and in One Word; They <i>Supply</i> the
<i>Want</i> of Knowledge, with an <i>Excess</i> of Zeal; and when they cannot
<i>Understand</i> the Plain English of a <i>Discourse</i>, they Wrap Themselves up
in the Mystery. The making of a <i>Party</i>, &amp; the Saving of their own
<i>Skins</i>, are the <i>Two Main Points</i> of the <i>Leaders</i>; and therefore, they
<i>Cover</i> themselves under Ambiguity, &amp; Riddle; &amp; Compass those Matters,
by <i>Theatrical Gesticulations</i>, &amp; <i>Actions</i>, which they dare not
<i>Venture</i> upon, in <i>Words</i> at <i>Length</i>, or by the <i>Dint</i> of <i>Argument</i>;
for there is no <i>Law</i> against <i>making of</i> Faces, <i>and Dusting of</i>
Cushions, They are told <i>Mightily</i>, and <i>Plainly</i>, of <i>Heaven</i>, and
<i>Hell</i>; but in such a <i>Manner</i>, that they will <i>Never Allow</i> God, and
the Government to be <i>Both of a side. Schism</i> is Dignified with the
<i>Name</i> of Conscience; the Story of their <i>Grievances</i>, is the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 37]</span>
<i>Bitterest</i> of Satyrs; Their very Petitions have the force of
<i>Invectives</i>; and the <i>Smoother</i>, the <i>Softer</i>, you find the <i>Surface</i>
of them, the <i>Falser</i>, and the more <i>Dangerous</i> they are at the
<i>Bottom</i>: For betwixt the Persecution that is <i>Insinuated</i>, on the part
of the <i>Government</i>, &amp; the Innocence, the Piety, and the Modesty, on
that of the Sufferers, Nothing can more Provoke, a <i>Horror</i>, and
<i>Indignation</i> for the <i>One</i>, or a <i>Tenderness</i>, &amp; <i>Compassion</i>, for the
<i>Other</i>.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> That is to say, among Those that are not <i>Well Enform'd</i>, in the
<i>Reason</i>, and <i>Equity of the Cause in Question</i>.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> Come Come. I tell ye <i>Nakedly</i> how things Are, and not how they
Ought to be: and I speak of <i>Those Men</i> too, that neither Do, nor Will,
nor Can make a <i>Right Judgment</i> upon the Matter in <i>Issue</i>. They do not
take down <i>Reasons</i> in Connexion; neither do their <i>Teachers</i> so much as
Offer at'em; But <i>their Work</i> is, only to <i>Feed</i> Itching Ears, and
Humours, with <i>New-Quoyn'd Words, Affectate Phrases</i>: And briefly, to
<i>Instruct</i> their <i>Disciples</i>, by <i>Signs</i> and <i>Tokens</i>, like so many
<i>Dancing Horses</i> to fall Lame upon all Four, for the <i>Pope</i>; to
come-over, for the <i>Grand Vizier</i>; and at the very <i>Sound</i> of Babylon,
Anti-Christ, or Absolute Power, to Snort, and Boggle, as if they <i>Smelt
Fire</i>. If I may tell ye the <i>Arrant Truth</i>, and <i>Simplicity</i> of my
<i>Heart</i>; This is the very Train of a Popular Institution. They are
Tutor'd, and Inur'd, to the Assuming of such and such <i>Passions</i>, upon
such and such <i>Occasions</i>; and they do All their <i>Ayres</i>, and <i>Tricks</i>,
by the Direction of the <i>Hand</i>, or <i>Eye. They Dance</i> to <i>Sounds, Hints,
Nodds, Forms</i>, and <i>Syllables</i>; not to the force of <i>Fair Reasonings</i>,
and <i>Natural Conclusions</i>; Nay, they are Taught, when to be <i>Angry</i>;
when to be <i>Pleas'd</i>; and their very <i>Inclinations</i>, and <i>Aversions</i>,
are none of their <i>Own, Neither</i>: The <i>Whole Bus'ness</i>, in short, is
Artifice, Manage, and Practice; for <i>All their</i> Mistakes, <i>and</i>
Mis-understandings, <i>take the</i> Same Biass.</p>

<p><i>Obs.</i> I do <i>Observe</i>, indeed, that they Shelter themselves under the
<i>Dark Prophets</i>, and the <i>Revelation</i>. The <i>Number of the Beast</i>, they
have all at their <i>Fingers Ends</i>; the <i>Geneva-Bibles</i> are <i>Thumm'd</i> over
and over, at the <i>Same Texts</i>: As upon the Subject of the <i>Groves</i>, &amp;
the <i>High Places, Christian Liberty, Will-Worship, Humane Inventions,
Idolatry, Superstition</i>, &amp;c. There's not a <i>Verse</i> in the whole <i>Bible</i>,
against <i>Persecution</i>, but makes them Shake their Heads at the<span class="pagenum">[Pg 38]</span>
<i>Government</i>. Popery by <i>Interpretation</i>, is Episcopacy: The <i>Liberty</i>
of the Subject, has an <i>Aking Tooth</i> at the <i>Prerogative</i> of the Prince:
But finally; such and such Terms, and Forms of Speaking, are, by Common
Consent, to pass for <i>Current</i>, under such or such a Sense, and Meaning,
how <i>Contrary</i> soever, to their <i>Proper</i>, and <i>Genuine Signification</i>,
or <i>Import</i>. But this speaks only to the Propagating of <i>Jelousies</i>, not
to the Rise of them.</p>

<p><i>Trim.</i> If you Ask me the [Rise] of <i>Jelousies</i>, I must <i>Answer</i> ye,
that they are <i>Begotten</i> betwixt Ambition, Avarice, Hypocrisy, Craft,
Malice, and Disloyalty, on the <i>One</i> side; and Ignorance, Obstinacy,
Blind Zeal, and an Impetuous Temerity, on the <i>Other</i>.</p>
